GSE3201	Gene expression diversity among Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) While several groups, including our own, have examined variability of M. tuberculosis at the DNA level, this is the first systematic survey of variability in mRNA expression among clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis. Genes whose expression varies among isolates when assayed under a single growth condition may make poor drug targets and vaccine antigens and may affect molecular diagnostics, so they can be used to narrow down lists of candidate molecules. Because the measurement of gene expression is extremely sensitive to environmental conditions, comparison of gene expression is labour intensive. In this study, we surveyed 12 strains. These strains are a subset of those for which we have already published genomic deletion information (Kato-Maeda et al., 2001). In order to ensure maximum reproducibility of the experiments and avoid complications caused by differences in growth conditions, we measured gene expression under well-controlled in vitro conditions. Our aims were to provide an overview of gene expression variability among clinical isolates under a single growth condition and to test whether gene functional classes are related to variability in expression.

GSE3999	Comparative expression studies of a complex phenotype: cord formation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Abstract: The aggregation of mycobacteria into structures known as cords is an intrinsic property of the human tubercle bacillus. This property is thought to be determined by the lipid composition of the bacterial cell surface and may contribute to the virulence of the organism. Using microarray technology, we compared the pattern of gene expression of H37Rv, a virulent, cording strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with H37Ra, an avirulent, non-cording strain derived from the same original patient isolate, under five different nutrient combinations and growth conditions. Under all of these conditions, H37Rv formed cords and H37Ra did not. By focusing our analysis only on genes that were differentially expressed under all conditions, we hoped to enrich the resulting gene list for genes associated with cording. We identified 22 genes that were consistently expressed at higher levels in H37Rv than in H37Ra under all conditions tested. Genes involved in lipid metabolism and the cell membrane were significantly enriched in our gene list, indicating that the cell wall and the cell membrane may be the major sites of difference between these two strains. This work represents a new strategy for enriching gene lists for relevant genes, which may also be applicable for other types of problems. A replicate experimental design type is where a series of replicates are performed to evaluate reproducibility or as a pilot study to determine the appropriate number of replicates for a subsequent experiments.

GSE5815	furB knockout [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) We used DNA microarrays to define the M. tuberculosis FurB regulon. For this porpouse we constructed a M. tuberculosis strain where furB was disrupted and its transcriptional profile was compared on DNA microarray with the transcriptional profile of its parental strain (H37Rv). A total of 32 genes included in 16 putative transcription units were shown to be up-regulated in the mutant relative to H37Rv. No repressed genes were identified. Seven representative genes were chosen from the microarray experiments and their expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR using sigA as invariant internal control. In support to the gene expression profiling data, the mRNA levels of all selected genes was clearly higher in the furB mutant strain relative to H37Rv  Keywords: comparative genomic hybridization1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySamples: 6GSM135570: KOfurB_rep2GSM135571: KOfurB_rep4GSM135574: KOfurB_rep5GSM135584: KOfurB_rep3GSM135563: KOfurB_rep1GSM135578: KOfurB_rep6	
GSE5977	Carboxyltransferase Subunit of the Acyl-CoA Carboxylase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) The Mycobacterium tuberculosis acyl-CoA carboxylases provide the building blocks for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis by fatty acid synthase (FAS) I and for the elongation of FAS I end-products by the FAS II complex to produce meromycolic acids. M. tuberculosis genome contains three biotin carboxylase subunits (AccA1-3) and 6 carboxyltransferase subunits (AccD1-6) of which AccD6 is located in a genetic locus that contains members of the FAS II complex. We found by microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis that the transcripts of AccA3, AccD4, AccD5 and AccD6 are expressed at high levels during exponential growth phases of M. tuberculosis in vitro.

Capreomycin is an important drug used for TB with multi-drug resistance. A recent study also indicates that this drug possesses unique bactericidal activity against non-replicating TB bacilli among known anti-TB drugs. Thus, there is an urgent need for investigating the full-spectrum action of capreomycin. Here we conduct the first microarray-based study on capreomycin using the high-resolution Affymetrix oligonucleotide GeneChip system. The results indicate that capreomycin primarily acts on the information pathways but it also significantly affects cell wall, cell processes, intermediate metabolism and respiration in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This study not only transcriptionally validates the specific molecular target, 16S rRNA, but also discovers potential new targets of capreomycin, including genes operating at the DNA level, such as Rv0054 (ssb) and Rv3715c (recR), as well as genes involved in cell division like Rv3260c (whiB2). In addition, the nuo gene cluster and the ATP synthase gene cluster are repressed.

GSE7622	Comparative genomic hybridizations of Mycobacterium avium isolates obtained from multiple host species [Mycobacterium avium; Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis; Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium]Summary: (Submitter supplied) A comparative genomic approach was used to identify large sequence polymorphisms among Mycobacterium avium isolates obtained from a variety of host species.  DNA microarrays were used as a platform for comparing mycobacteria field isolates with the sequenced bovine isolate Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) K10.  ORFs were classified as present or divergent based on the relative fluorescent intensities of the experimental samples compared to Map K10 DNA.  Map isolates cultured from cattle, bison, sheep, goat, avian, and human sources were hybridized to the Map microarray.  Three large deletions were observed in the genomes of four Map isolates obtained from sheep and four clusters of ORFs homologous to sequences in the Mycobacterium avium subsp. avium (Maa) 104 genome were identified as being present in these isolates.  One of these clusters encodes glycopeptidolipid biosynthesis enzymes.  One of the Map sheep isolates had a genome profile similar to a group of Mycobacterium avium subsp. silvaticum (Mas) isolates which included four independent laboratory stocks of the organism traditionally identified as Maa strain 18.  Genome diversity in Map appears to be mostly restricted to large sequence polymorphisms that are often associated with mobile genetic elements.

GSE8639	Regulation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosishypoxic response gene encoding alpha-crystallin [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Unlike many pathogens that are overtly toxic to their hosts, the primary virulence determinant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be its ability to persist for years or decades within humans in a clinically latent state. Since early in the 20th century latency has been linked to hypoxic conditions within the host, but the response of M. tuberculosis to a hypoxic signal remains poorly characterized. The M. tuberculosis alpha-crystallin (acr) gene is powerfully and rapidly induced at reduced oxygen tensions, providing us with a means to identify regulators of the hypoxic response. Using a whole genome microarray, we identified >100 genes whose expression is rapidly altered by defined hypoxic conditions. Numerous genes involved in biosynthesis and aerobic metabolism are repressed, whereas a high proportion of the induced genes have no known function. Among the induced genes is an apparent operon that includes the putative two-component response regulator pair Rv3133cy Rv3132c. When we interrupted expression of this operon by targeted disruption of the upstream gene Rv3134c, the hypoxic regulation of acr was eliminated. These results suggest a possible role for Rv3132cy3133cy3134c in mycobacterial latency.

GSE8664	The Mycobacterium tuberculosis ECF sigma Factor sE: role in global gene expression and survival in macrophages [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) In previously published work, we identified three Mycobacterium tuberculosis sigma (s) factor genes responding to heat shock (sigB, sigE and sigH ). Two of them (sigB and sigE ) also responded to SDS exposure. As these responses to stress suggested that the s factors encoded by these genes could be involved in pathogenicity, we are studying their role in physiology and virulence. In this work, we characterize a sigE mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The sigE mutant strain was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to heat shock, SDS and various oxidative stresses. It was also defective in the ability to grow inside both human and murine unactivated macrophages and was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to the killing activity of activated murine macrophages. Using microarray technology and quantitative reverse transcriptionÐpolymerase chain reaction (RTÐPCR), we started to define the sigmaE regulon of M. tuberculosis and its involvement in the global regulation of the stress induced by SDS. We showed the requirement for a functional sigE gene for full expression of sigB and for its induction after SDS exposure but not after heat shock. We also identified several genes that are no longer induced when sigmaE is absent. These genes encode proteins belonging to different classes including transcriptional regulators, enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation and classical heat shock proteins.

GSE8689	Role of the extracytoplasmic-function sigma Factor sigmaH in Mycobacterium tuberculosis global gene expression [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Like other bacterial species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has multiple sigma (s) factors encoded in its genome. In previously published work, we and others have shown that mutations in some of these transcriptional activators render M. tuberculosis sensitive to various environmental stresses and, in some cases, cause attenuated virulence phenotypes. In this paper, we characterize a M. tuberculosis mutant lacking the ECF s factor sigma-H. This mutant was more sensitive than the wild type to heat shock and to various oxidative stresses, but did not show decreased ability to grow inside macrophages. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and microarray technology, we have started to define the sigma-H regulon and its involvement in the global regulation of the response to heat shock and the thiol-specific oxidizing agent diamide. We identified 48 genes whose expression increased after exposure of M. tuberculosis to diamide; out of these, 39 were not induced in the sigH mutant, showing their direct or indirect dependence on sigma-H. Some of these genes encode proteins whose predicted function is related to thiol metabolism, such as thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and enzymes involved in cysteine and molybdopterine biosynthesis. Other genes under sigma-H control encode transcriptional regulators such as sigB, sigE, and sigH itself.

GSE8732	Role of IdeR in Iron-Dependent Gene Expression, Iron Metabolism, and Oxidative Stress Response [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) The mycobacterial IdeR protein is a metal-dependent regulator of the DtxR (diphtheria toxin repressor) family. In the presence of iron, it binds to a specific DNA sequence in the promoter regions of the genes that it regulates, thus controlling their transcription. In this study, we provide evidence that ideR is an essential gene in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. ideR cannot normally be disrupted in this mycobacterium in the absence of a second functional copy of the gene. However, a rare ideR mutant was obtained in which the lethal effects of ideR inactivation were alleviated by a second-site suppressor mutation and which exhibited restricted iron assimilation capacity. Studies of this strain and a derivative in which IdeR expression was restored allowed us to identify phenotypic effects resulting from ideR inactivation. Using DNA microarrays, the iron-dependent transcriptional profiles of the wild-type, ideR mutant, and ideR complemented mutant strains were analyzed, and the genes regulated by iron and IdeR were identified. These genes encode a variety of proteins, including putative transporters, proteins involved in siderophore synthesis and iron storage, members of the PE/PPE family, a membrane protein involved in virulence, transcriptional regulators, and enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.

GSE8786	Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene expression during adaptation to stationary phase and low-oxygen dormancy [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) The innate mechanisms used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to persist during periods of non-proliferation are central to understanding the physiology of the bacilli during latent disease. We have used whole genome expression profiling to expose adaptive mechanisms initiated by M. tuberculosis in two common models of M. tuberculosis non-proliferation. The first of these models was a standard growth curve in which gene expression changes were followed from exponential growth through the transition to stationary phase. In the second model, we followed the adaptive process of M. tuberculosis during transition from aerobic growth to a state of anaerobic non-replicating persistence. The most striking finding from these experiments was the strong induction of the entire DosR dormancy regulon over approximately 20 days during the long transition to an anaerobic state. This is contrasted by the muted overall response to aerated stationary phase with only a partial dormancy regulon response. From the results presented here we conclude that the respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted NRP model recreates at least one fundamental factor for which the genome of M. tuberculosis encodes a decisive adaptive program.

GSE8827	M. tuberculosis response to macrophage intracellular cues - Role of contact, phagosome pH, time, strain [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) A central feature of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) pathogenesis is the ability of Mtb to survive within macrophages (MØ). Despite its critical importance our appreciation of the interplay between these two cells remains superficial. In this study we employed microarrays to conduct a stepwise dissection of Mtb-MØ interaction during the invasion of resting bone-marrow MØ. Contrary to many bacterial pathogens, engagement by MØ receptors without internalization did not alter Mtb gene expression. Subsequently, a high-resolution profile of Mtb invasion-linked gene expression was generated by assaying the Mtb transcriptome at 20 min intervals up to 2 hours post-infection. Transcriptional responses were detected within minutes of phagocytosis, including gene subsets with distinct temporal profiles. Pharmacological manipulation of phagosomal pH and in vitro acid stress studies revealed that vacuole acidification is an important trigger for differential gene expression. Finally, there are marked species-specific differences in the response of Mtb and M. bovis BCG to intraphagosomal cues.

GSE8829	Rv3133c/dosR is a transcription factor that mediates the hypoxic response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Unlike many pathogens that are overtly harmful to their hosts, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can persist for years within humans in a clinically latent state. Latency is often linked to hypoxic conditions within the host. Among M. tuberculosis genes induced by hypoxia is a putative transcription factor, Rv3133c/DosR. We performed targeted disruption of this locus followed by transcriptome analysis of wild-type and mutant bacilli. Nearly all the genes powerfully regulated by hypoxia require Rv3133c/DosR for their induction. Computer analysis identified a consensus motif, a variant of which is located upstream of nearly all M. tuberculosis genes rapidly induced by hypoxia. Further, Rv3133c/DosR binds to the two copies of this motif upstream of the hypoxic response gene alpha-crystallin. Mutations within the binding sites abolish both Rv3133c/DosR binding as well as hypoxic induction of a downstream reporter gene. Also, mutation experiments with Rv3133c/DosR confirmed sequence-based predictions that the C-terminus is responsible for DNA binding and that the aspartate at position 54 is essential for function. Together, these results demonstrate that Rv3133c/DosR is a transcription factor of the two-component response regulator class, and that it is the primary mediator of a hypoxic signal within M. tuberculosis.

GSE8830	A member of the cAMP receptor protein family of transcription regulators in M. tuberculosis is required for virulence [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Deletion of gene Rv3676 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis coding for a transcription factor belonging to the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) family caused growth defects in laboratory medium, in bone marrow-derived macrophages and in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Transcript profiling of M. tuberculosis grown in vitro identified 16 genes with significantly altered expression in the mutant compared with the wild type. Analysis of the DNA sequences upstream of the corresponding open reading frames revealed that 12 possessed sequences related to a consensus CRP binding site that could represent the sites of action of Rv3676. These included rpfA, lprQ, whiB1 and ahpC among genes with enhanced expression in the wild type, and Rv3616c-Rv3613c, Rv0188 and lipQ among genes exhibiting enhanced expression in the mutant. The activity of an rpfA::lacZ promoter fusion was lowered in the Rv3676 mutant and by mutation of the predicted Rv3676 binding site. Moreover, the product of Rv3676 (isolated as a TrxA fusion protein) interacted specifically with the rpfA promoter, and binding was inhibited by mutation of the Rv3676 site. Although Rv3676 retains four of the six amino acid residues that bind cAMP in Escherichia coli CRP addition of cAMP did not enhance Rv3676 binding at the rpfA promoter in vitro. In summary, it has been shown that Rv3676 is a direct regulator of rpfA expression, and because rpfA codes for a resuscitation promoting factor this may implicate Rv3676 in reactivation of dormant M. tuberculosis infections.

GSE8839	Inhibition of Respiration by Nitric Oxide Induces a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Dormancy Program [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) An estimated two billion persons are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The host factors that initiate and maintain this latent state and the mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis survives within latent lesions are compelling but unanswered questions. One such host factor may be nitric oxide (NO), a product of activated macrophages that exhibits antimycobacterial properties. Evidence for the possible significance of NO comes from murine models of tuberculosis showing progressive infection in animals unable to produce the inducible isoform of NO synthase and in animals treated with a NO synthase inhibitor. Here, we show that O2 and low, nontoxic concentrations of NO competitively modulate the expression of a 48-gene regulon, which is expressed in vivo and prepares bacilli for survival during long periods of in vitro dormancy. NO was found to reversibly inhibit aerobic respiration and growth. A heme-containing enzyme, possibly the terminal oxidase in the respiratory pathway, likely senses and integrates NO and O2 levels and signals the regulon. These data lead to a model postulating that, within granulomas, inhibition of respiration by NO production and O2 limitation constrains M. tuberculosis replication rates in persons with latent

GSE9331	Defined hypoxic model timecourse of H37Rv and H37Rv:deltadosR [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Background: A significant body of evidence accumulated over the last century suggests a link between hypoxic microenvironments within the infected host and the latent phase of tuberculosis.  Studies to test this correlation have identified the M. tuberculosis initial hypoxic response, controlled by the two-component response regulator DosR.  The initial hypoxic response is completely blocked in a dosR deletion mutant. Methodology/Principal Findings: We show here that a dosR deletion mutant enters bacteriostasis in response to in vitro hypoxia with only a relatively mild decrease in viability.  In the murine infection model, the phenotype of the mutant was indistinguishable from that of the parent strain.  These results suggested that additional genes may be essential for entry into and maintenance of bacteriostasis.  Detailed microarray analysis of oxygen starved cultures revealed that DosR regulon induction is transient, with induction of nearly half the genes returning to baseline within 24 hours.  In addition, a larger, sustained wave of gene expression follows the DosR-mediated initial hypoxic response.  This Enduring Hypoxic Response (EHR) consists of 230 genes significantly induced at four and seven days of hypoxia but not at initial time points.  These genes include a surprising number of transcriptional regulators that could control the program of bacteriostasis.  We found that the EHR is independent of the DosR-mediated initial hypoxic response, as EHR expression is virtually unaltered in the dosR mutant. Conclusions/Significance: Our results suggest a reassessment of the role of DosR and the initial hypoxic response in MTB physiology.  Instead of a primary role in survival of hypoxia induced bacteriostasis, DosR may regulate a response that is largely optional in vitro and in mouse infections.  Analysis of the EHR should help elucidate the key regulatory factors and enzymatic machinery exploited by M. tuberculosis for long-term bacteriostasis in the face of oxygen deprivation.

GSE10391	In vitro dormancy achieved by multiple stresses in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv]Summary: (Submitter supplied) The human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, develops a dormant infection, in which organisms survive within the body. We established a unique in vitro dormancy model based on the characterization of drug-resistance to INH and rifampin. M. tuberculosis cells were maintained in controlled and defined multiple stress conditions with low oxygen (5% dissolved oxygen tension), acid (pH 5.) along with glycerol-deprived medium conditions. To monitor gene expression changes in M. tuberculosis in response to the multiple stresses, we performed microarray analysis at the time point of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12days after treatment. M. tuberculosis adapting to multiple stresses displayed characteristics associated with persistence in vivo, including entry into a non-replicative state and the repression of genes involved in energy regeneration. Under in vitro multiple-stresses, M. tuberculosis significantly modulated gene expression mainly in response to the starvation stresses. Cells exposed to these multiple stress conditions shows significant drug-resistance. Comparison with other in vivo expression profiles demonstrates induction of several common genes for in vitro dormancy conditions.

GSE11315	BCG vaccine strains lack narK2 and narX induction and exhibit altered phenotypes during dormancy [Mycobacterium bovis; Mycobacterium bovis BCG; Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of tuberculosis, a disease that affects one-third of the world’s population. The sole extant vaccine for tuberculosis is the live attenuated Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG). We examined 13 representative BCG strains from around the world to ascertain their ability to express DosR-regulated dormancy antigens. These are known to be recognized by T-cells of M. tuberculosis infected individuals, especially those harboring latent infections. Differences in expression of these antigens could be valuable for use as diagnostic markers to distinguish BCG vaccination from latent tuberculosis. We determined that all BCG strains were defective for induction of two dormancy genes, narK2 (Rv1737c) and narX (Rv1736c). NarK2 is known to be necessary for nitrate respiration during anaerobic dormancy. Analysis of the narK2/X promoter region revealed a base substitution mutation in all tested BCG strains and M. bovis in comparison to the M. tuberculosis sequence. We also show that nitrate reduction by BCG strains during dormancy was greatly reduced compared to M. tuberculosis and varied between tested strains. Several dormancy regulon transcriptional differences were also identified among the strains, as well as variation in their growth and survival. These findings demonstrate defects in DosR regulon expression during dormancy and phenotypic variation between commonly used BCG vaccine strains.

GSE13780	Intracellular expression pattern of recombinant Mtb strain TB294 overexpressing sigma factor A [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) We previously showed that increased expression of the principal sigma factor, SigA, mediates the capacity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 210 strains to grow more rapidly in human monocytes, compared to other strains. To identify SigA-regulated genes that favor intracellular mycobacterial growth, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression between a recombinant M. tuberculosis 210 strain bearing a sense sigA construct and a vector control during growth in MonoMac6 cells. The most strongly upregulated gene in the sense sigA transformant was Rv2416c, which has previously been shown to enhance intracellular survival of M. smegmatis, and has been designated as eis. Real-time PCR confirmed marked upregulation of eis mRNA by the intracellular sense sigA transformant, and lysates of this transformant contained high concentrations of the Eis protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SigA bound the eis promoter region in live bacteria. Deletion of the eis gene reduced growth of M. tuberculosis in macrophages, and complementation of eis reversed this effect. We conclude that SigA regulates eis expression, which in turn contributes to the enhanced capacity of the M. tuberculosis 210 strain to grow in human macrophages.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySupplementary Files: GPRSamples: 4GSM346759: Mtb strain TB294 overexpressing sigma factor A (experiment 1)GSM346785: Mtb strain TB294 overexpressing sigma factor A (experiment 1 dye-flip)GSM346812: Mtb strain TB294 overexpressing sigma factor A (experiment 2 dye-flip)GSM346811: Mtb strain TB294 overexpressing sigma factor A (experiment 2)

GSE14005	Transcriptional responses of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to lung surfactant  [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) This study uses microarray analyses to examine gene expression profiles for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induced by exposure in vitro to bovine lung surfactant preparations that vary in apoprotein content: (i) whole lung surfactant (WLS) containing the complete mix of endogenous lipids and surfactant proteins (SP)-A, -B, -C, and -D; (ii) extracted lung surfactant (CLSE) containing lipids plus SP-B and -C; (iii) column-purified surfactant lipids (PPL) containing no apoproteins, and (iv) purified human SP-A. Exposure to WLS evoked a multitude of transcriptional responses in Mtb, with 52 genes up-regulated and 23 genes down-regulated at 30 min exposure, plus 146 genes up-regulated and 27 genes down-regulated at 2 h.  Notably, WLS rapidly induced several membrane-associated lipases that presumptively act on surfactant lipids as substrates, and a large number of genes involved in the synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), a cell wall component known to be important in macrophage interactions and Mtb virulence. Exposure of Mtb to CLSE, PPL, or purified SP-A caused a substantially weaker transcriptional response (≤ 20 genes were induced) suggesting that interactions among multiple lipid-protein components of WLS may contribute to its effects on Mtb transcription. 1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySupplementary Files: TXTSamples: 8GSM351507: Mtb response to PPL 2h (2 replicates)GSM349959: Mtb response to WLS 30 min (5 replicates)GSM350081: Mtb response to CLSE 2h (2 replicates)GSM351533: Mtb response to PPL 30 min (2 replicates)GSM349122: Mtb response to WLS 2h (3 replicates)GSM350870: Mtb response to CLSE 30 min (4 replicates)GSM351689: Mtb response to SP-A 2h (2 replicates)GSM351699: Mtb response to uncoated SP-A (4 replicates)

GSE16146	The response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to reactive oxygen and nitrogen species [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) The bacteriostatic and bactericidal effects and the corresponding expression profiles of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to representative oxidative and nitrosative stresses were investigated by growth and survival studies and whole genome expression analysis.  The response of M. tuberculosis to a range of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) concentrations tended to fall into three distinct categories: (1) low level exposure resulted in induction of few H2O2 sensitive genes, (2) intermediate exposure resulted in massive transcriptional changes without an effect on growth or survival, and (3) high exposure resulted in a muted transcriptional response and eventual death. Nitric oxide (NO) exposure initiated much of the same transcriptional response as H2O2. However, unlike H2O2 exposure, NO exposure affected a dose-dependent bacteriostatic activity without killing and induction of dormancy-related genes. Included in the shared response to H2O2 and NO was the induction of genes encoding oxidative stress detoxification and iron-sulfur cluster repair functions. Expression of several key oxidative stress defense genes was constitutive, or increased moderately from an already elevated level, suggesting bacilli that are continually primed for oxidative stress defense. Deletion of the known oxidative stress responsive regulator, FurA, resulted in the constitutive expression of furA, katG, and Rv1907c; while other genes do not appear to be solely controlled by FurA. In contrast to Escherichia coli, M. tuberculosis appears highly resistant to DNA damage-dependent killing caused by low mill molar levels of H2O2. Furthermore, instead of limiting access to iron to prevent hydroxyl radical formation from H2O2 and thus DNA damage, M. tuberculosis induced iron uptake genes in response to H2O2 and NO.3 related

GSE16811	The unique roles of DosT and DosS in DosR regulon induction and Mycobacterium tuberculosis dormancy [Mycobacterium tuberculosis CDC1551; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv]Summary: (Submitter supplied) In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the sensor kinases DosT and DosS activate the transcriptional regulator DosR, resulting in the induction of the DosR regulon, important for anaerobic survival and perhaps latent infection. The individual and collective roles of these sensors has been postulated biochemically, but their roles have remained unclear in vivo. This work demonstrates distinct and additive roles for each sensor during anaerobic dormancy. Both sensors are necessary for wild type levels of DosR regulon induction, and concomitantly, full induction of the regulon is required for wild type anaerobic survival. In the anaerobic model, DosT plays an early role, responding to hypoxia. DosT then induces the regulon and with it DosS, which sustains and further induces the regulon. DosT then loses its functionality as oxygen becomes limited, and DosS alone maintains induction of the genes from that point forward. Thus, M. tuberculosis has evolved a system whereby it responds to hypoxic conditions in a stepwise fashion as it enters an anaerobic state.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySupplementary Files: GPRSamples: 36GSM422038: dosSKO_RAD_day6_rep1GSM422041: dosTKO_RAD_day6_rep1GSM422044: dosSTKO_RAD_day6_rep1GSM422051: dosTKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep2GSM422054: dosSKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep2GSM422057: dosSTKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep3GSM422064: dosSTKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep1GSM422067: dosSKO_log_1_hour_NO_rep1GSM422070: dosSKO_log_1_hour_NO_rep4GSM422073: dosTKO_log_1_hour_NO_rep3GSM422040: dosSKO_RAD_day6_rep3GSM422047: dosSTKO+pdosT_RAD_day6_rep1GSM422050: dosTKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep1GSM422053: dosSKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep1GSM422060: dosTKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep3GSM422063: dosSKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep3GSM422066: dosSTKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep3GSM422069: dosSKO_log_1_hour_NO_rep3GSM422039: dosSKO_RAD_day6_rep2GSM422042: dosTKO_RAD_day6_rep2GSM422045: dosSTKO_RAD_day6_rep2GSM422048: dosSTKO+pdosT_RAD_day6_rep2GSM422052: dosTKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep3GSM422055: dosSTKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep1GSM422058: dosTKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep1GSM422061: dosSKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep1GSM422068: dosSKO_log_1_hour_NO_rep2GSM422071: dosTKO_log_1_hour_NO_rep1GSM422043: dosTKO_RAD_day6_rep3GSM422046: dosSTKO_RAD_day6_rep3GSM422049: dosSTKO+pdosT_RAD_day6_rep3GSM422056: dosSTKO_4_hour_Gaspak_rep2GSM422059: dosTKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep2GSM422062: dosSKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep2GSM422065: dosSTKO_24_hour_Gaspak_rep2GSM422072: dosTKO_log_1_hour_NO_rep2	
GSE17191	Implications of high level pseudogene transcription in Mycobacterium leprae [Mycobacterium leprae]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Approximately half of M. leprae’s transcriptome consists of inactive gene products. This has an impact on overall energy and resource consumption without potential benefit to this organism. However, multiple translational ‘silencing’ mechanisms are present, reducing additional energy and resource expenditure required for protein production from these transcripts.  The Mycobacterium leprae genome has less than 50% coding capacity and 1,133 pseudogenes. Preliminary evidence suggests that some pseudogenes are expressed. Therefore, defining pseudogene transcriptional and translational potentials should increase our understanding of their impact on M. leprae physiology.  To address this, M. leprae was purified from the granulomatous hind footpad tissue of four individual nu/nu nude mice six months post-infection. M. leprae whole genome DNA microarrays representing the 1,614 annotated ORFs and 1,133 identified pseudogenes, were obtained from the Leprosy Research Support and Maintenance of an Armadillo Colony Post-Genome Era, Part I: Leprosy Research Support Contract (NO1 AI-25469) at Colorado State University. To validate 20% of genes positive by microarray analysis, RT-PCR was performed.  Results of this study Gene expression analysis identified transcripts from 49% of all M. leprae genes including 57% of all ORFs and 43% of all pseudogenes in the genome. Pseudogenes were randomly distributed throughout the chromosome. Factors resulting in pseudogene transcription included: 1) co-orientation of transcribed pseudogenes with transcribed ORFs within or exclusive of operon-like structures; 2) the paucity of intrinsic stem-loop transcriptional terminators between transcribed ORFs and downstream pseudogenes; and 3) predicted pseudogene promoters. Mechanisms for translational silencing of pseudogene transcripts included the lack of both translational start codons and strong Shine-Dalgarno sequences. Transcribed pseudogenes also contained multiple in-frame stop codons and high Ka/Ks ratios, compared to that of homologs in M. tuberculosis and ORFs in M. leprae. A pseudogene transcript containing an active promoter, strong SD site, a start codon, but containing two in frame stop codons yielded a protein product when expressed in E. coli. Approximately half of M. leprae's transcriptome consists of inactive gene products consuming energy and resources without potential benefit to M. leprae. Presently it is unclear what additional detrimental affect(s) this large number of inactive mRNAs has on the functional capability of this organism. Translation of these pseudogenes may play an important role in overall energy consumption and resultant pathophysiological characteristics of M. leprae. However, this study also demonstrated that multiple translational silencing mechanisms are present, reducing additional energy and resource expenditure required for protein production from the vast majority of these transcripts.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySamples: 4GSM429958: Mleprae Biological Rep 2GSM429959: Mleprae Biological Rep 3GSM429957: Mleprae Biological Rep 1GSM429960: Mleprae Biological Rep 4

GSE17640	Bioactive Pyridine-N-oxide Disulfides from Allium stipitatum [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) In this study, the researchers isolated a colorless waxy solid from the chloroform extract of Allium stipitatum as Compound 1. They demonstrated compound 1 is a potent bactericidal agent against nonreplicating Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Using microarray technology the authors report gene expression profiles in cells treated with either 2, 5, or 10 ug/ml of compound 1 or an equivalent amount of DMSO as control for 6 h. Gene expression studies revealed that transcriptional profiles elicited in response to compound 1 were similar to the profiles generated during treatment of cells with compounds such as menadione and 8-quinolinol that result in oxidative stress. They included the thioredoxin system components encoded by trxB2 and trxC as well as several genes associated with the heat shock response such as clpB, sigH, dnaJ, dnaK, hsp, Rv0331, Rv3463, Rv3054c, and Rv1334-Rv1335. These results suggest that compound 1 possibly generates damaged proteins and other oxidative stress signals as part of its mechanism of action.   The following is the full abstract of this published study.  O'Donnell G, et al. (2009) J Nat Prod 72(3):360-365  From Allium stipitatum, three pyridine-N-oxide alkaloids (1-3) possessing disulfide functional groups were isolated. The structures of these natural products were elucidated by spectroscopic means as 2-(methyldithio)pyridine-N-oxide (1), 2-[(methylthiomethyl)dithio]pyridine-N-oxide (2), and 2,2'-dithio-bis-pyridine-N-oxide (3). The proposed structure of 1 was confirmed by synthetic S-methylthiolation of commercial 2-thiopyridine-N-oxide. Compounds 1 and 2 are new natural products, and 3 is reported for the first time from an Allium species. All compounds were evaluated for activity against fast-growing species of Mycobacterium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a multidrug-resistant (MDR) variants of S. aureus. Compounds 1 and 2 exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 0.5-8 mug/ml against these strains. A small series of analogues of 1 were synthesized in an attempt to optimize antibacterial activity, although the natural product had the most potent in vitro activity. In a whole-cell assay at 30 mug/ml, 1 was shown to give complete inhibition of the incorporation of (14)C-labeled acetate into soluble fatty acids, indicating that it is potentially an inhibitor of fatty acid biosynthesis. In a human cancer cell line antiproliferative assay, 1 and 2 displayed IC(50) values ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 muM with a selectivity index of 2.3 when compared to a human somatic cell line. Compound 1 was evaluated in a microarray analysis that indicated a similar mode of action to menadione and 8-quinolinol by interfering with the thioredoxin system and up-regulating the production of various heat shock proteins. This compound was also assessed in a mouse model for in vivo toxicity. A dose response design type examines the relationship between the size of the administered dose and the extent of the response of the organism(s).

Growth was monitored as OD600 nm and recorded on a daily basis. In all experiments, the starting OD600 nm was 0.04-0.05. Aliquots were removed at each OD600 nm to make serial dilutions, plate onto 7H10 OADC agar plates for CFU counts. When cells reached OD600 nm of 0.3, 1.0, and 1.5, a 10-30 mL aliquot was taken, centrifuged 3 min at 3000 g, at room temperature, and the supernatant was discarded, with cell pellets being immediately frozen by inclusion into dry ice. Frozen cell pellets were stored at -80oC for later RNA isolation. In all experiments, RNA from WT was labeled with Cy5, and RNA from the opp KO was labeled with Cy3. In all experiments, the microarray comparsion used RNA from cells of the same growth stage, i.e., WT OD 0.3 vs opp KO OD 0.3, WT OD 1.0 vs opp KO OD 1.0, and WT OD 1.5 vs opp KO OD 1.5.

GSE18575	Maltose-1-Phosphate Stress Stimulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) New chemotherapeutics are urgently required to control the tuberculosis pandemic fueled by the emergence of multidrug- and extensively-drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains and the bacterium`s catastrophic alliance with HIV. Here we describe a novel trehalose-to-α-glucan pathway in M. tuberculosis comprising four enzymatic steps mediated by TreS, Pep2, GlgB, and GlgE, identified as an essential maltosyltransferase capable of utilizing maltose 1-phosphate. Using traditional and chemical reverse genetics, we show that GlgE inactivation causes rapid death of M. tuberculosis in vitro and in mice, through self-poisoning by maltose 1-phosphate accumulation driven by a self-amplifying feedback loop promoting pleiotropic phosphosugar-induced stress responses. Moreover, this α-glucan pathway exhibited a synthetic lethal interaction with the glucosyltransferase Rv3032 involved in biosynthesis of specialized α-glucan derivatives. The unique combination of gene essentiality within a synthetic lethal pathway validates GlgE as a new class of drug targets, revealing novel synergistic mechanisms to induce death in M. tuberculosis.  Transcriptional profiling was performed to characterize the lethality induced by maltose 1-phosphate accumulation. Triplicate 10 mL cultures of the conditional lethal Mtb mutant strain H37Rv Delta treS Delta glgE (pMV361::treS) and of the vector control strain H37Rv Delta treS Delta glgE (pMV361) were grown in liquid culture to log-phase in the presence of 5 mM validamycin A (VA) to suppress M1P formation. Subsequently, cells were washed to remove the inhibitor; after 48 h of starvation for VA cultures were harvested.

GSE18652	ChIP-chip of HA-tagged Lsr2 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis [Mycobacterium smegmatis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv; Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Bacterial nucleoid-associated proteins play important roles in chromosome organization and global gene regulation. We find that Lsr2 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a novel nucleoid-associated protein that specifically binds AT-rich regions of the genome, including regions encoding major virulence factors, such as the ESX secretion systems, the lipid virulence factors PDIM/PGL, and the PE/PPE families of antigenic proteins. Comparison of genome-wide binding data with expression data indicates that Lsr2 binding results in transcriptional repression. Domain swamping experiments demonstrate that Lsr2 has an N-terminal dimerization domain and a C-terminal DNA binding domain. NMR analysis of the DNA binding domain of Lsr2 and its interaction with DNA reveals a novel structure and a unique mechanism that enables Lsr2 to discriminately target AT-rich sequences through interactions with the minor groove of DNA. Taken together, we provide evidence that mycobacteria have employed a structurally distinct molecule with an apparently different DNA recognition mechanism to achieve an equivalent function as the Enterobacteriaceae H-NS, coordinating global gene regulation and virulence in this group of medically important bacteria.2 related PlatformsType: Genome binding/occupancy profiling by genome tiling arraySupplementary Files: TXTSamples: 2GSM463387: Mycobacterium smegmatisGSM463378: Mycobacterium tuberculosis	
GSE18909	Nicotinamide Starvation of Mycobacteria Defective for de novo NAD Biosynthesis [Mycobacterium bovis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Mycobacteria can synthesize NAD+ using either the de novo biosynthesis pathway or the salvage pathway.  The deletion of the three genes involved specifically in the NAD+ de novo biosynthesis pathway in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis had no effect on the growth of the strain in vivo.  In contrast, the same deletion in the bovine pathogen Mycobacterium bovis resulted in a strain that could not grow in vivo and could only grow in vitro with substantial nicotinamide supplmentation.  This striking difference was attributed to the known defect in the nicotinamidase PncA of M. bovis, since introducing the M. tuberculosis pncA gene into the M. bovis strain defective for de novo NAD+ biosynthesis restored growth in vitro and in vivo.  This study demonstrates that NAD+ starvation is a cidal event in mycobacteria and confirms that enzymes common to the de novo and salvage pathways may be good drug targets.  We also propose that simultaneously targeting both the salvage and the de novo NAD+ biosynthesis pathways represents a potentially effective way to treat infection with tubercle bacilli. To characterize the lethality induced by nicotinamide starvation transcriptional profiling of the auxotrophs was performed. Triplicate 50 mL cultures of M. tuberculosis and M. bovis Delta nadABC mutants were grown in 7H9 OADC glycerol 0.05% tween broth in 500 mL roller bottles to an OD600nm= 0.1 in a roller incubator at 37°C.

GSE19433	Profiling antibody responses to M. tuberculosis proteins in TB suspects’ sera using full-proteome microarrays. [Homo sapiens; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Understanding the immune response to tuberculosis requires greater knowledge of humoral responses.  To characterize antibody targets and the effect of disease parameters on target recognition, we developed a systems immunology approach that integrated detection of antibodies against the entire Mycobacterium tuberculosis proteome, bacterial metabolic and regulatory pathway information, and patient data.  Probing 4,000 M. tuberculosis proteins with sera from >500 suspected tuberculosis patients worldwide revealed that antibody responses recognized 10% of the bacterial proteome.  This result defines the immunoproteome of M. tuberculosis, which is rich in membrane-associated and extracellular proteins.  Most serum reactivity during active tuberculosis focused onto 0.5% of the proteome.  Within this pool, which is selectively enriched for extracellular proteins (but not for membrane-associated proteins), relative target preference varied among patients.  The shift in relative M. tuberculosis protein reactivity observed with active tuberculosis defines the evolution of the humoral immune response during M. tuberculosis infection and disease.1 related

GSE19774	Characterization of Mycobacterium smegmatis SigF regulon [Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Mycobacterium smegmatis SigF is a group III sigma factor. Its ortholog in M. tuberculosis is reported to have role in regulation and function of cell wall components. In present study we have created an M. smegmatis ΔsigF mutant by allele exchange method. M. smegmatis sigF mutant shows non pigmented phenotype and is more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide generated oxidative stress. DNA microarray analysis of M. smegmatis wild type and ΔsigF mutant suggests that SigF in this species controls the expression of several energy and central intermediary metabolism genes along with regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis. 1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySupplementary Files: TXTSamples: 8GSM493895: WT_log phase_rep1GSM493898: WT_stationary phase_rep2 GSM493901: KO_stationary phase_rep1 GSM493897: WT_stationary phase_rep1 GSM493900: KO_log phase_rep2 GSM493899: KO_log phase_rep1 GSM493902: KO_stationary phase_rep2 GSM493896: WT_log phase_rep2

GSE21590	Reaeration timecourse from a defined hypoxia model [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Reaeration timecourse from a defined hypoxia model in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.  The mechanism by which mycobacteria return to a replicating state upon re-exposure to favorable conditions is not well understood. In this study, we utilized reaeration from a defined hypoxia model to characterize the adaptive response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) following a return to favorable growth conditions. Global transcriptional analysis identified the 100 gene Reaeration Response, induced relative to both log-phase and hypoxic MTB. This response includes chaperones and proteases, as well as the transcription factor Rv2745c, a Clp protease gene regulator (ClgR) orthologue.  During reaeration, genes repressed during hypoxia are also upregulated in a wave of transcription that includes genes crucial to transcription, translation and oxidative phosphorylation.3 related PlatformsType: Expression profiling by arraySupplementary Files: GPRSamples: 33GSM538975: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep2GSM538978: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep5GSM538985: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep8GSM538988: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep7GSM538991: H37Rv_24hour reaeration_rep6GSM538998: H37Rv_12hour reaeration_rep2GSM539001: H37Rv_12hour reaeration_rep5GSM539004: H37Rv_24hour reaeration_rep2GSM538974: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep1GSM538981: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep8GSM538984: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep7GSM538987: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep6GSM538990: H37Rv_24hour reaeration_rep5GSM538994: H37Rv_6hour reaeration_rep3GSM538997: H37Rv_12hour reaeration_rep1GSM539000: H37Rv_12hour reaeration_rep4GSM539003: H37Rv_24hour reaeration_rep1GSM538976: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep3GSM538979: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep6GSM538982: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep5GSM538989: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep8GSM538992: H37Rv_6hour reaeration_rep1GSM538995: H37Rv_6hour reaeration_rep4GSM539002: H37Rv_12hour reaeration_rep6GSM539005: H37Rv_24hour reaeration_rep3GSM538977: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep4GSM538980: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep7GSM538983: H37Rv_1hour reaeration_rep6GSM538986: H37Rv_4hour reaeration_rep5GSM538993: H37Rv_6hour reaeration_rep2GSM538996: H37Rv_6hour reaeration_rep5GSM538999: H37Rv_12hour reaeration_rep3GSM539006: H37Rv_24hour reaeration_rep4	
GSE21932	DosR-regulon genes induction in Mycobacterium bovis BCG under aerobic conditions [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) In this report we demonstrated that under aerobic conditions, Mycobacterium bovis BCG expressing an hsp60-driven second copy of the hypoxia-related transcriptional regulator DosR increased 2-fold or greater the expression of 38 out of the 48 genes belonging to the DosR regulon, including the latency antigens Rv1733c, Rv2029, Rv2627, and Rv2628. Expression of DosR under these conditions slightly delayed in vitro growth, but did not promote a non-replicating state as opposed to microaerobic and hypoxic adaptation. Our results suggest BCG producing DosR can be cultured under standard in vitro  conditions, allowing evaluation of this strain as a latency-specific vaccine candidate.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySamples: 22GSM545595: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 2GSM545602: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.2 rep 4GSM545605: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 3GSM545608: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.2 rep 2GSM545611: H37Rv dosR KO vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 4GSM545593: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 1GSM545596: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 4GSM545599: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.2 rep 1GSM545606: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.2 rep 4GSM545609: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.4 rep 1GSM545612: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.2 rep 5GSM545594: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.2 rep 3GSM545597: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.4 rep 2GSM545600: H37Rv dosR KO vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 2GSM545603: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.4 rep 3GSM545610: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.2 rep 1GSM545613: H37Rv dosR KO vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 1GSM545598: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.4 rep 4GSM545601: BCG wild type vs BCG with empty pMV361 at OD 0.4 rep 5GSM545604: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.2 rep 2GSM545607: H37Rv dosR KO vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.4 rep 3GSM545614: BCG wild type vs BCG with pMFdosR at OD 0.2 rep 3	
GSE21963	DosS responds to a reduced electron transport system to induce the Mycobacterium tuberculosis DosR regulon [Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv]Summary: (Submitter supplied) The DosR regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis is involved in respiration-limiting conditions and its induction is controlled by two histidine kinases, DosS and DosT. Recent experimental evidence indicates DosS senses either molecular oxygen or a redox change. This report demonstrates that DosS responds to a reduced electron transport system (ETS), although this does not rule out a role for oxygen in silencing signaling. Under aerobic conditions induction of the DosR regulon by DosS but not DosT was observed after the addition of ascorbate, a powerful cytochrome c reductant, demonstrating DosS responds to a redox signal even in the presence of high oxygen tension. During hypoxic conditions regulon induction was attenuated by treatment with compounds that occluded electron flow into the menaquinone pool or decreased the size of the menaquinone pool itself. Increased regulon expression during hypoxia was observed when exogenous menaquinone was added, demonstrating the menaquinone pool is a limiting factor in regulon induction. Taken together these data indicate that a reduced menaquinone pool directly or indirectly triggers induction of the DosR regulon via DosS. Biochemical analysis of menaquinones upon entry into hypoxic/anaerobic conditions demonstrated the disappearance of the unsaturated species and low-level maintenance of the mono-saturated menaquinone. Relative to the unsaturated form, an analog of the saturated form is better able to induce signaling via DosS, rescue inhibition of menaquinone synthesis, and is less toxic. The menaquinone pool is central to the ETS and therefore provides a mechanistic link between the respiratory state of the bacilli and DosS signaling.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySupplementary Files: GPRSamples: 5GSM546222: dosTKO_rep3GSM546220: dosTKO_rep1GSM546223: dosSKO_rep1GSM546221: dosTKO_rep2GSM546224: dosSKO_rep2	
GSE22854	Transcriptional profiling of M. tuberculosis CDC1551 wild type vs aprABC null, aprBC null, aprC null and phoP transposon mutants. [Mycobacterium tuberculosis]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Following phagocytosis by macrophages, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) senses the intracellular environment and remodels its gene expression for growth in the phagosome. Abramovitch et.al. in this current study identified an Acid and Phagosome Regulated (aprABC) locus that is unique to the Mtb complex and whose gene expression is induced during growth in acidic environments in vitro and in macrophages. The authors propose a model where phoP senses the acidic pH of the phagosome and induces aprABC expression to fine-tune processes unique for intracellular adaptation of Mtb complex bacteria.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySamples: 12GSM564808: CDC1551 wild type vs aprABC null mutant rep 3GSM564811: CDC1551 wild type vs aprBC null mutant rep 1GSM564814: CDC1551 wild type vs aprABC null mutant rep 1GSM564805: CDC1551 wild type vs aprBC null mutant rep 3GSM564809: CDC1551 wild type vs aprBC null mutant rep 2GSM564812: CDC1551 wild type vs aprC null mutant rep 2GSM564803: CDC1551 wild type vs aprABC null mutant rep 2GSM564806: CDC1551 wild type vs phoP Tn mutant rep 3GSM564813: CDC1551 wild type vs phoP Tn mutant rep 2GSM564804: CDC1551 wild type vs aprC null mutant rep 1GSM564807: CDC1551 wild type vs phoP Tn mutant rep 1GSM564810: CDC1551 wild type vs aprC null mutant rep 3

GSE30236	Analyses of the GlnR- and AmtR- dependent nitrogen regulatory network of Mycobacterium smegmatis. [Mycobacterium smegmatis; Mycobacterium smegmatis str. MC2 155]Summary: (Submitter supplied) Total transcriptome analyses were carried out to investigate changes in transcript patterns in the Mycobacterium smegmatis wild type strain SMR5 due to nitrogen starvation and to expand the knowledge about the role of the two transcriptional regulators of nitrogen metabolism, namely GlnR and AmtR, in these processes. A first experiment revealed enhanced transcript levels of 284 genes and reduced transcripts of 231 genes in the wild type under nitrogen starvation compared to nitrogen surplus. When glnR deletion strain MH1 was compared to the wild type under nitrogen starvation, decreased transcript levels of 125 genes were detected, indicating that these are activated by GlnR due to nitrogen limitation. Comparing amtR deletion strain YL1 to the wild type under nitrogen starvation, enhanced transcript levels of 2 genes were found, indicating that they are repressed by AmtR under nitrogen surplus. A comparison of YL1 and wild type under surplus, as well as a comparison of YL1 under nitrogen surplus and starvation and of MH1 under nitrogen surplus and starvation were carried out as additional control experiments. It can be concluded that GlnR is the master regulator of nitrogen control in M. smegmatis and that AmtR fulfills only a small, subordinate role in the regulation of an operon.

GSE30299	Identification of the WhiB5 regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv [Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv]Summary: (Submitter supplied) We used DNA microarrays to define the M. tuberculosis whiB5 regulon and to study the variation of the global transcription profile in response of its induction. For this purpose we constructed a M. tuberculosis strain in which whiB5 was transcribed from an pristinamycin-inducible promoter and its transcriptional profile was compared on DNA microarray with the transcriptional profile of its control strain (empty vector-containing clone). WhiB5 induction for 15’ resulted in the induction of 26 genes, while induction for 3 h resulted in the induction of 58 genes. Interestingly, all of the 26 genes induced after 15 minutes of incubation with pristinamycin were still induced after 3 h of incubation. No repressed genes were identified. Among the induced genes we found the alternative sigma factor SigM and at least 12 genes previously shown to be regulated by this sigma factor, including those encoding the ESX-4 type VII secretion system. Interestingly, also the genes encoding ESX-2 type VII secretion system were strongly induced together with an operon probably involved in hydrogen metabolism in anaerobiosis. 10 representative genes were chosen from the microarray experiments and their expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR using sigA as invariant internal control. In support to the gene expression profiling data, the mRNA levels of all selected genes was clearly higher in the whiB5 mutant strain relative to control.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySupplementary Files: TXTSamples: 8GSM751088: Mtb_whiB5_15'_rep3GSM751091: Mtb_whiB5_3 hours_rep2GSM751087: Mtb_whiB5_15'_rep2GSM751090: Mtb_whiB5_3 hours_rep1GSM751089: Mtb_whiB5_15'_rep4GSM751092: Mtb_whiB5_3 hours_rep3GSM751086: Mtb_whiB5_15'_rep1GSM751093: Mtb_whiB5_3 hours_rep4

GSE32249	Transcriptome analysis of the Tap efflux pump mutant in Mycobacterium bovis BCG. [Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Mycobacterium bovis BCG]Summary: (Submitter supplied) We used DNA microarrays to define the physiological roles of the Tap efflux pump in M. bovis BCG during the exponential and the stationary phase of in vitro growth. For this purpose we constructed a M. bovis BCG strain in which the tap gene was inactivated by the insertion of a hygromycin resistance cassette (Ω-hyg). When the gene expression patterns of the tap mutant were compared to the wild-type strain, almost no differences were observed during exponential growth; only seven genes slightly increased their expression. In contrast, more that 100 genes showed a variation in their level of expression during stationary growth. More than ten representative genes were chosen from the microarray experiments and their expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR using sigA as invariant internal control. In support to the gene expression profiling data, the mRNA levels of all selected genes was significantly different in the tap mutant strain relative to control. A functional category analysis (http://tuberculist.epfl.ch/index.html) of the genes differentially expressed revealed a high proportion belonging to the Virulence, Detoxification, Adaptation (VDA), Intermediary Metabolism and Respiration (IMR), Conserved Hypotheticals (CH), and Cell Wall and Cell Processing (CWCP) categories suggesting a major adaptation to a stress generated by inactivation of the tap efflux pump gene.1 related PlatformType: Expression profiling by arraySamples: 8GSM799063: BCG_KOtap_exp_rep1GSM799066: BCG_KOtap_exp_rep4GSM799064: BCG_KOtap_exp_rep2GSM799067: BCG_KOtap_stat_rep1GSM799070: BCG_KOtap_stat_rep4GSM799069: BCG_KOtap_stat_rep3GSM799065: BCG_KOtap_exp_rep3GSM799068: BCG_KOtap_stat_rep2
