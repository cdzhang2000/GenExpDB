S. aureus 50583 was isolated from a foodborne outbreak where the source of infection was traced to a pizza
      </Characteristics>
      <Biomaterial-Provider>Norwegian Veterinary Institute
</Biomaterial-Provider>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
St. aureus was inoculated in TSB and incubated at 200 rpm and 37 oC. At an OD600 of 1.0 corresponding to 108 CFUml-1 HCl was added to directly bring the pH down to 4.5. The sample was withdrawn 2 min after addition of acid and directly transferred to RNA Protect Bacteria reagent (Qiagen).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Precultures of S. aureus 50583 were prepared by inoculation of frozen glycerol culture to 1 ml Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Oxoid) and incubation overnight at 200 rpm and 37 oC. 
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Prep kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 1.5 ml bacterial culture was added directly to 3 ml RNA Protect Bacteria reagent, vortexed for 5 s, incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 40 ul Tris-EDTA buffer followed by addition of 50 ul lysozyme stock solution (40 mgml-1) and 10 ul lysostaphin stock solution (1mg ml-1l). The samples were incubated at 37 oC with shaking for 10 min. The manufacturer’s protocol including use of kit buffers was followed from this point. RNase-free water was added to the membrane of the RNeasy mini spin column and after 1 min incubation at room temperature the RNA was eluted by centrifugation of the column at 10 000 x g for 1 min. The concentration and purity of the total RNA were analysed with an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech) and the RNA 600 Nano LabChip system (Agilent Technologies).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Cy5</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA was reverse transcribed by using random hexamers in the presence of aminoallyl-dUTP, followed by labeling with Cy5 monoreactive dye (TIGR protocol, standard operating procedure no. M007). Briefly, 2 ug of total RNA and 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 18.5 ul were denatured at 70 oC for 10 min, snap cooled on ice for 30 s and centrifuged briefly to bring down condensation. Then 6 ul of First Strand buffer (Invitrogen), 3 ul of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.2 ul of 12.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate-aminoallyl-dUTP labeling mix (Invitrogen) and 400 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added. The labeling reaction mixture was incubated at 42 oC overnight. The first-strand synthesis reaction was stopped by adding 10 ul of 0.5 M EDTA and 10 ul of 1 M NaOH. The reaction mixture was incubated at 65 oC for 15 min, and then 25 ul of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) was added. The removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free amines was performed according to the TIGR protocol with the Qiagen QIA-quick PCR purification kit. After being dried in a Speed Vac, the samples were stored at –80 oC. Coupling of aminoallyl-labeled cDNA to Cy Dye Ester (Amersham Biosciences) was done according to the TIGR protocol.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The eluted Cy3- and Cy5-labeled samples were mixed and dried in a Speed Vac. The hybridisation of the labeled cDNA probes was performed according to protocol from TIGR (Standard operating procedure no. M008). Briefly, slides were incubated in a preheated prehybridization buffer (5x SSC [1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1% Bovine Serum Albumin), at 42 oC for at least one hour. After prehybridization the slides were washed in distilled water (5x 2 min in 50 ml tubes) and then in 50 ml isopropanol. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g for 12 min at room temperature. The dried Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA was resuspended in 60 l hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 300 g Salmon Sperm DNA), denatured at 95 oC for 5 min, vortexed at low speed and heated again at 95 oC for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged briefly and applied to the prehybridized microarray under a coverslip (LifterSlip, Erie Scientific Company). The slides were placed in a waterproof hybridization chamber for hybridization in a 42 oC water bath overnight. After hybridization the slides were washed in 2x SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS (55 oC, 2 min), then washed in 0.1x SSC with 0.1% SDS buffer (room temperature, 2 min), followed by two washes in 0.1x SSC buffer (room temperature, 2 min). The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g at room temperature for 12 min.

Total RNA was extracted by using the RNeasy Protect Bacteria Mini Prep kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 1.5 ml bacterial culture was added directly to 3 ml RNA Protect Bacteria reagent, vortexed for 5 s, incubated at room temperature for 5 min and then centrifuged at 10 000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The supernatant was discarded and the pellet resuspended in 40 ul Tris-EDTA buffer followed by addition of 50 ul lysozyme stock solution (40 mgml-1) and 10 ul lysostaphin stock solution (1mg ml-1l). The samples were incubated at 37 oC with shaking for 10 min. The manufacturer’s protocol including use of kit buffers was followed from this point. RNase-free water was added to the membrane of the RNeasy mini spin column and after 1 min incubation at room temperature the RNA was eluted by centrifugation of the column at 10 000 x g for 1 min. The concentration and purity of the total RNA were analysed with an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech) and the RNA 600 Nano LabChip system (Agilent Technologies).

Total RNA was reverse transcribed by using random hexamers in the presence of aminoallyl-dUTP, followed by labeling with Cy5 monoreactive dyes (TIGR protocol, standard operating procedure no. M007). Briefly, 2 ug of total RNA and 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 18.5 ul were denatured at 70 oC for 10 min, snap cooled on ice for 30 s and centrifuged briefly to bring down condensation. Then 6 ul of First Strand buffer (Invitrogen), 3 ul of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.2 ul of 12.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate-aminoallyl-dUTP labeling mix (Invitrogen) and 400 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added. The labeling reaction mixture was incubated at 42 oC overnight. The first-strand synthesis reaction was stopped by adding 10 ul of 0.5 M EDTA and 10 ul of 1 M NaOH. The reaction mixture was incubated at 65 oC for 15 min, and then 25 ul of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) was added. The removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free amines was performed according to the TIGR protocol with the Qiagen QIA-quick PCR purification kit. After being dried in a Speed Vac, the samples were stored at –80 oC. Coupling of aminoallyl-labeled cDNA to Cy Dye Ester (Amersham Biosciences) was done according to the TIGR protocol.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The hybridisation of the labeled cDNA probes was performed according to protocol from TIGR (Standard operating procedure no. M008). Briefly, slides were incubated in a preheated prehybridization buffer (5x SSC [1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1% Bovine Serum Albumin), at 42 oC for at least one hour. After prehybridization the slides were washed in distilled water (5x 2 min in 50 ml tubes) and then in 50 ml isopropanol. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g for 12 min at room temperature. The dried Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA was resuspended in 60 ul hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 300 ug Salmon Sperm DNA), denatured at 95 oC for 5 min, vortexed at low speed and heated again at 95 oC for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged briefly and applied to the prehybridized microarray under a coverslip (LifterSlip, Erie Scientific Company). The slides were placed in a waterproof hybridization chamber for hybridization in a 42 oC water bath overnight. After hybridization the slides were washed in 2x SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS (55 oC, 2 min), then washed in 0.1x SSC with 0.1% SDS buffer (room temperature, 2 min), followed by two washes in 0.1x SSC buffer (room temperature, 2 min). The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g at room temperature for 12 min.

Total RNA was reverse transcribed by using random hexamers in the presence of aminoallyl-dUTP, followed by labeling with Cy3 monoreactive dyes (TIGR protocol, standard operating procedure no. M007). Briefly, 2 ug of total RNA and 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen) in a reaction volume of 18.5 ul were denatured at 70 oC for 10 min, snap cooled on ice for 30 s and centrifuged briefly to bring down condensation. Then 6 ul of First Strand buffer (Invitrogen), 3 ul of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.2 ul of 12.5 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate-aminoallyl-dUTP labeling mix (Invitrogen) and 400 U of Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added. The labeling reaction mixture was incubated at 42 oC overnight. The first-strand synthesis reaction was stopped by adding 10 ul of 0.5 M EDTA and 10 ul of 1 M NaOH. The reaction mixture was incubated at 65 oC for 15 min, and then 25 ul of 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) was added. The removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free amines was performed according to the TIGR protocol with the Qiagen QIA-quick PCR purification kit. After being dried in a Speed Vac, the samples were stored at –80 oC. Coupling of aminoallyl-labeled cDNA to Cy Dye Ester (Amersham Biosciences) was done according to the TIGR protocol.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The hybridisation of the labeled cDNA probes was performed according to protocol from TIGR (Standard operating procedure no. M008). Briefly, slides were incubated in a preheated prehybridization buffer (5x SSC [1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1% Bovine Serum Albumin), at 42 oC for at least one hour. After prehybridization the slides were washed in distilled water (5x 2 min in 50 ml tubes) and then in 50 ml isopropanol. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g for 12 min at room temperature. The dried Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA was resuspended in 60 ul hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 300 ug Salmon Sperm DNA), denatured at 95 oC for 5 min, vortexed at low speed and heated again at 95 oC for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged briefly and applied to the prehybridized microarray under a coverslip (LifterSlip, Erie Scientific Company). The slides were placed in a waterproof hybridization chamber for hybridization in a 42 oC water bath overnight. After hybridization the slides were washed in 2x SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS (55 oC, 2 min), then washed in 0.1x SSC with 0.1% SDS buffer (room temperature, 2 min), followed by two washes in 0.1x SSC buffer (room temperature, 2 min). The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g at room temperature for 12 min.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The hybridisation of the labeled cDNA probes was performed according to protocol from TIGR (Standard operating procedure no. M008). Briefly, slides were incubated in a preheated prehybridization buffer (5x SSC [1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.015 M sodium citrate], 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 1% Bovine Serum Albumin), at 42 oC for at least one hour. After prehybridization the slides were washed in distilled water (5x 2 min in 50 ml tubes) and then in 50 ml isopropanol. The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g for 12 min at room temperature. The dried Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNA was resuspended in 60 ul hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 300 ug Salmon Sperm DNA), denatured at 95 oC for 5 min, vortexed at low speed and heated again at 95 oC for 5 min. The sample was centrifuged briefly and applied to the prehybridized microarray under a coverslip (LifterSlip, Erie Scientific Company). The slides were placed in a waterproof hybridization chamber for hybridization in a 42 oC water bath overnight. After hybridization the slides were washed in 2x SSC buffer with 0.1% SDS (55 oC, 2 min), then washed in 0.1x SSC with 0.1% SDS buffer (room temperature, 2 min), followed by two washes in 0.1x SSC buffer (room temperature, 2 min). The slides were dried by centrifugation at 90 x g at room temperature for 12 min.

    <Title>Acid shock responses in Staphylococcus aureus</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE7273</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>17600073</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
We present a general overview of the changes in the genetic expression along a time curve through the first 20 minutes after acidification to pH 4.5 of exponentially growing cultures of the food pathogenic strain Staphylococcus aureus 50583. A newly developed method for statistical significance testing was used to detect significant gene expression responses. Most responses showed an increase or decrease from time zero to 10 minutes after acidification and then generally a stabilisation in expression level from 10 to 20 min. Increased urease activity appeared to be an important factor in the acid defence along with proton excretion by NADH dehydrogenase and macromolecule repair mechanisms. Oxidative stress responses such as increased expression of thioredoxin genes and upregulation of  pentose phosphate pathway genes to generate more reducing power were also induced. A general reduction in the expression of genes encoding ribosomal proteins and genes involved in nucleotide synthesis as well as fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism reflected the lowered growth rate after acidification. The pH shock did not appear to trigger major virulence responses or biofilm formation. The metal ion regulation and transport was affected by the acid shock and production of several cofactors such as molybdopterin was increased. Many of the presented observations could be explained, while some represent still unknown mechanisms. The patterns of regulation were confirmed by real time reverse transcriptase PCR. Together these results showed the main responses of S. aureus and will be a good starting point for future more specific in-depth studies of specific gene responses in conjunction with acid stress defence of S. aureus.

At an OD600 of 1.0 corresponding to 108 CFUml-1 the control samples were withdrawn immediately prior to the addition of HCl to directly bring the pH down to 4.5. Samples were withdrawn 2, 5, 10 and 20 min after addition of acid. All samples were directly transferred to RNA Protect Bacteria reagent (Qiagen). This procedure was repeated at three different days for a total of three sample sets (parallels). Separate array experiments were performed on all three parallels.
