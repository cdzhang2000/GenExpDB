H37Rv (wild type)
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (GIBCOy BRL) and transferred to 2-ml screw-cap tubes containing 0.4-ml of 0.1-mm diameter zirconiaysilica beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All the experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivatives obtained during this study. Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml. Sucrose selection was performed on 7H10 plates with 8% sucrose.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads
(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described. Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step.

Biological replicate 1 of 3. Comparison between H37Rv (wild type) and sigH mutant. Cell culture untreated.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described. Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step.

Biological replicate 3 of 3. Comparison between H37Rv (wild type) and sigH mutant. Cell culture untreated.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads
(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

      <Growth-Protocol>
All the experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivatives obtained during this study. Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml. Sucrose selection was performed on 7H10 plates with 8% sucrose.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads
(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described. Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step.

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described. Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step.

Biological replicate 2 of 6. Cell culture exposed to Diamide 5 mM for 60 minutes. sigH mutant
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

All the experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivatives obtained during this study. Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads
(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min.

Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml. Sucrose selection was performed on 7H10 plates with 8% sucrose.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads
(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

    <Title>Role of the extracytoplasmic-function sigma Factor sigmaH in Mycobacterium tuberculosis global gene expression</Title>

    <Summary>
Like other bacterial species, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has multiple sigma (s) factors encoded in its genome. In previously published work, we and others have shown that mutations in some of these transcriptional activators render M. tuberculosis sensitive to various environmental stresses and, in some cases, cause attenuated virulence phenotypes. In this paper, we characterize a M. tuberculosis mutant lacking the ECF s factor sigma-H. This mutant was more sensitive than the wild type to heat shock and to various oxidative stresses, but did not show decreased ability to grow inside macrophages. Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and microarray technology, we have started to define the sigma-H regulon and its involvement in the global regulation of the response to heat shock and the thiol-specific oxidizing agent diamide. We identified 48 genes whose expression increased after exposure of M. tuberculosis to diamide; out of these, 39 were not induced in the sigH mutant, showing their direct or indirect dependence on sigma-H. Some of these genes encode proteins whose predicted function is related to thiol metabolism, such as thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and enzymes involved in cysteine and molybdopterine biosynthesis. Other genes under sigma-H control encode transcriptional regulators such as sigB, sigE, and sigH itself.
