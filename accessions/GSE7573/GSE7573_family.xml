    <Summary>
The goals of this project were: to use transcriptomics as a starting point for reverse engineering the NO response network of E. coli, and to identify the targets responsible for NO-induced bacteriostasis.  The data is associated with Hyduke DR*, Jarboe LR*, Tran LM, Chou KJY, Liao JC 2007 &quot;Integrated network analysis identifies nitric oxide response networks and dihydroxyacid dehydratase as a crucial target in Escherichia coli. &quot;Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104(20):8484-8489.
Keywords: Comparative genomic response.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The associated samples were analyzed with Network Component Analysis and the transcription factor perturbations were verfied with knockouts and phenotypic assays.
