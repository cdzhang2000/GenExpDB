    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

There are 6088 probes, spotted in duplicate, on the array that target three different E. coli genomes: serotype O157:H7 strains Sakai and EDL-933, serotype K12 MG 1655.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

8 ml of the culture was mixed with 1/10V 10% phenol:ethanol buffer to stabilize the RNA, and centrifuged at 4 oC, 4300 × g for 30 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was decanted and cell pellets were suspended in 5 ml of buffer (2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaOAc, pH 5.2) before mixing with equal volume of hot acid-phenol:chloroform (pH 4.5 with Iso Amyl Alcohol (IAA), 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, TX) and incubating at 65 oC with periodic shaking for 10 min. The samples were centrifuged at 3220 × g for 20 min and the supernatant was subjected to further extractions with phenol:chloroform and chloroform:IAA (3). RNA was precipitated overnight at -70 oC in 2.5 volume 100% ethanol and 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA purification and DNase treatment of RNA samples were done with the Rneasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and RNA quality was assessed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel.

    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

There are 6088 probes, spotted in duplicate, on the array that target three different E. coli genomes: serotype O157:H7 strains Sakai and EDL-933, serotype K12 MG 1655.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.

An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    <Data-Processing>
Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.  Subsequent to local Lowess normalization, averaging of replicate probes and log2 transformation,  the microarray data were fitted to a 2-factor mixed ANOVA model (intensity = Array + Dye + Clade + Stx + Clade:Stx + Sample; where the biological replicate (Sample) and array effects were considered random effects, while all other effects were considered fixed effects), using the MAANOVA package (version 0.98-8) in R software (version 2.2.1).  This model allows independent consideration of the effect of ‘Clade’ (clade divergence) and ‘Stx’ (stx type variation) parameters on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains, as well as their interaction (combined) effect (Clade:Stx).  Overall differences in gene expression between groups were determined using the Fs test, followed by pair-wise contrasts to determine significant differential expression between each pair of groups.  Subsequently, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Clade’ effect to determine significant differences in gene expression between clades 8 (n=12) and 2 (n=12), regardless of stx profile.  Similarly, the Fs statistic was estimated for the ‘Stx’ effect as well as the ‘Clade:Stx’ interaction effect to examine the combined effect of clade and stx type on differences in gene expression among O157:H7 strains.  In other words, this analysis will determine whether the expression of any given gene among groups with different stx types is also dependent on clade.  An interaction effect would be observed if expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2 and clade2stx2 are different from expression estimates between strain groups clade8stx2,2c and clade2stx1,2.  For every analysis, 1000 permutations of the data were performed to generate P values; estimates were considered significant if the P value was &lt; 0.05 after adjusting for multiple comparisons.

    <Summary>
Transcriptomes of 24 clinical strains of E. coli O157:H7 that differ phylogenetically and by Shiga toxin profiles were compared after 30 min co-incubation with epithelial cells. 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Total RNA was harvested from the 24 O157:H7 strains exposed to, but not attached to, MAC-T epithelial cell monolayers for 30 min, using a previously described in vitro model of O157:H7 exposure to MAC-T cells. The microarray platform (Operon E. coli oligo set version 1.0.2) probes for 5978 ORFs from E. coli O157:H7 Sakai, O157:H7 EDL 933, and K12 MG1655, and for 110 ORFs from the pO157 plasmid.  Thirty-six dye-swap hybridizations were performed between four groups with six strains per group, according to a balanced double loop design.  Strains were grouped based on cladestx profiles and each strain was considered an independent biological replicate of its group (n=6).  The six strains from each group were randomly hybridized with six strains from every other group; each hybridization compared a pair of strains that differed in either clade or stx profile, or both.
