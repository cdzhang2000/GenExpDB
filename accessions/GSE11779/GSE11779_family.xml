    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

To lyse the cells, 1.0 mL RLT buffer (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) and 0.2 mL 0.1 mm zirconia/silica beads (Biospec) were added to the frozen bead beater tubes containing the cell pellets. The tubes were closed tightly and beat for 50 seconds at the maximum speed in a mini bead beater (cat. no. 3110BX, Biospec). The total RNA was isolated by following the protocol of the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) including an on-column DNase digestion with RNase-free DNase I (Qiagen).

The total RNA samples were first converted into cDNA through a reverse transcription reaction with poly-A RNA controls spiked into the same reaction mixture to monitor the entire target labeling process.  The cDNA was then digested with DNase I (Amersham Biosciences) to produce 50-200 bp fragments, which was checked by running the fragmented cDNA on a 2% agarose gel.  The fragmented cDNA was labeled at the 3’ termini by the Enzo BioArray Terminal Labeling Kit with Biotin-ddUTP (Affymetrix, P/N 900181).

The biotin-labeled target was hybridized to the Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli array at 45C for 16 hour at 60 rpm using the Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix), then a three-step fluorescent staining was conducted using the Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix) during the washing and staining procedure.

    <Scan-Protocol>
The microarray was scanned at 570 nm to get an image file by the GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).  Using GeneChip® Operating Software, total cell intensity was scaled automatically in the software to an average value of 500.

    <Description>
For the microarray experiments, 10 g glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.) were used to form biofilms in 250 mL LB ( 1 mM IPTG + Cm30) in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks which were inoculated with overnight cultures diluted that were 1:100.  The cells were shaken at 250 rpm and 30C for 12 hours to form biofilms on the glass wool, and RNA was isolated from the suspension cells and the biofilm.

    <Title>Protein Engineering of the Quorum-Sensing Regulator SdiA of Escherichia coli</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE11779</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19168658</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The Escherichia coli quorum-sensing regulator, SdiA, belongs to the LuxR family of transcriptional regulators and is responsible for detecting signals from other bacteria.  Previously we found that SdiA is necessary for E. coli to control its biofilm formation with indole just as SdiA is necessary for E. coli to alter its biofilm formation in the presence of N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs).  Here we engineered SdiA by random mutagenesis to further control biofilm formation in the presence of indole and AHLs. After screening of 477?? mutants with indole and two AHLs (N-butyryl-DL-homoserine lactone, and N-(3-oxooctanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, C6HSL), five SdiA variants were obtained that altered biofilm with and without signals of indole and AHLs.  Two truncation variants (1E11 and 14C3) lacking the C-terminal DNA-binding domain of SdiA showed the reduction of biofilm formation by 5-fold and 10-fold in LB and LB glu, respectively.  DNA microarrays show that the evolved SdiA (1E11) compared to wild-type SdiA influences indole synthesis genes, AI-2 uptake genes, acid-resistance genes, motility related genes, cold-shock protein genes, and several regulatory protein genes. Corroborating DNA microarrays, SdiA variants produced various amounts of indole which led to different survivals in low pH and influenced swimming motility and final cell density. Also, an AHL sensitive variant (2D10) 2-fold increased biofilm formation in the presence of C6HSL, while another variant (6B12) lowered biofilm formation in the presence of C6HSL. Hence, the results clearly showed that mutation of SdiA itself directly controls biofilm formation and SdiA variants could be further recognized by the inter-species signal AHLs. This is the first random protein engineering to control biofilm formation.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
For the microarray experiments, 10 g glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.) were used to form biofilms in 250 mL LB ( 1 mM IPTG + Cm30) in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks which were inoculated with overnight cultures diluted that were 1:100.  The cells were shaken at 250 rpm and 30C for 12 hours to form biofilms on the glass wool, and RNA was isolated from the the biofilm cells.
