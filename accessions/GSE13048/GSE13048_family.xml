Samples (30 ml) were harvested directly into cold phenol ethanol (187 µl phenol, 3.56 ml ethanol) to stabilize RNA, and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit as recommended by suppliers. RNA was quantified using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf).

      <Label-Protocol>
Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 µl of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 µl dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 µl 0.1 M DTT, 2 µl 1 mM Cy3 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 µl of 1M) and HCl (7.5 µl of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 µl).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample, vacuum-dried and re-suspended in 120 µl salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 2× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).  
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
The labelling procedure uses equal quantities of RNA from adequate CO-RM and control cultures.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 µl of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 µl dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 µl 0.1 M DTT, 2 µl 1 mM Cy3 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 µl of 1M) and HCl (7.5 µl of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 µl).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample, vacuum-dried and re-suspended in 120 µl salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 2× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).

    <Data-Processing>
Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 µl of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 µl dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 µl 0.1 M DTT, 2 µl 1 mM Cy3 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 µl of 1M) and HCl (7.5 µl of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 µl).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample, vacuum-dried and re-suspended in 120 µl salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 2× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).  
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
The labelling procedure uses equal quantities of RNA from adequate CO-RM and control cultures.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 µl of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 µl dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 µl 0.1 M DTT, 2 µl 1 mM Cy3 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 µl of 1M) and HCl (7.5 µl of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 µl).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample, vacuum-dried and re-suspended in 120 µl salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 2× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).  
    </Scan-Protocol>

The labelling procedure uses equal quantities of RNA from adequate CO-RM and control cultures.

Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 µl of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 µl dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 µl 0.1 M DTT, 2 µl 1 mM Cy5 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 µl of 1M) and HCl (7.5 µl of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 µl).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample, vacuum-dried and re-suspended in 120 µl salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 2× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min before scanning.

Samples (30 ml) were harvested directly into cold phenol ethanol (187 µl phenol, 3.56 ml ethanol) to stabilize RNA, and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit as recommended by suppliers. RNA was quantified using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf).

Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 µl of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 µl dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 µl 0.1 M DTT, 2 µl 1 mM Cy3 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 µl Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 µl of 1M) and HCl (7.5 µl of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 µl).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample, vacuum-dried and re-suspended in 120 µl salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 2× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 1500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).  
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
The labelling procedure uses equal quantities of RNA from adequate CO-RM and control cultures.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.
