DNA sequences for the 3163 C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 predicted protein-encoding genes were obtained from The Joint Genome Institute using sequence assembled in November 2003. Oligonucleotide probes that represented the whole genome of C. thermocellum were designed using the CommOligo software and were commercially synthesized without modification (MWG Biotech, High Point, NC) in 96-well plates. The concentration of the probes was adjusted to 100 pmol/JlL, transferred to 384-well printing plates in a final concentration of 50% dimethyl sulfoxide using a BioMek FX liquid handling robot (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA) and then spotted onto UltraGAPS glass slides (Corning Life Sciences, Corning, NY) using a BioRobotics Microgrid II microarrayer (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI) in a dust-free clean room maintained at 21°C and 50% relative humidity. Spotted DNA was stabilized on slides by ultraviolet crosslinking using an Ultraviolet 1800 Stratalinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the slide manufacturer's instructions (Corning Life Sciences). Oligonucleotide probes originally designed based on the 2003 draft genome sequence were BLAST compared against the 2006 fully assembled genome to identify the corresponding open reading frames in the completed genome.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

    <Description>
Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

Batch fermentations of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain were conducted in 3L BioStat B jacketed glass fermentors (Sartorius Stedim Biotech, Bohemia, NY) using a 2L working volume of MTC medium (mineral salt medium containing 1g/L yeast extract; [16]) at 58C and 300rpm, with pH controlled at 7.0 using 3N NaOH. Fermentors with medium containing only the carbon substrate, 5g/L crystalline cellulose (Avicel® PH105, FMC Biopolymer, Philadelphia, PA), were sparged with ultra-high purity nitrogen and vigorously agitated overnight, followed by addition of the remaining medium components and sparged for an additional 2-3hrs with nitrogen gas. A 10% v/v inoculum of overnight (16-20hrs) 5g/L Avicel® bottle cultures was used to inoculate the fermentors and the gas inlet/exhaust lines were clamped post inoculation.

Fermentation samples for RNA isolation were harvested by spinning down ~30mL culture in 50mL Oak Ridge tubes at 8000 rpm and 4C for 10-15mins and the supernatant was discarded. The solid pellet fraction containing cells and any residual Avicel® was resuspended in 1mL of TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80C until further use. Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets as follows. Briefly, the frozen cell solution in TRIzol was thawed on ice and the cell solution (~1mL) was added to a 2mL tube containing 1mL of 0.1mm glass beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK) ashed at 250C overnight. Cells were lysed by rapid agitation of the tubes at 6500rpm for 1min in three 20s-On/20s-Off cycles using the Precellys® bead beater (Bertin Technologies, France). Subsequently, the cell lysate (~0.8mL) in TRIzol was phase separated by addition of 200uL chloroform and the RNA was precipitated by addition of 500uL 100% isopropanol. The precipitated RNA pellet was washed with 1mL of 75% ethanol and resuspended in 100uL of RNase-free water. Any contaminating DNA was digested by in-solution DNase-I (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) treatment and the RNA sample was cleaned using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) as per manufacturer’s instructions.

The 6hr time-point total RNA sample was used as the reference and all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared to the reference in cDNA/cDNA arrays. For each time-point comparison, equal amount of the extracted total RNA samples was labeled with Cy3-dUTP/Cy5-dUTP fluorescent dyes (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ), mixed and hybridized onto custom oligo-arrays in dye swap experiments as described earlier [Chhabra SR, J Bacteriol., 2006 188(5); PMID 16484192].

    <Description>
Microarrays containing 2980 unique and 10 group 70-mer oligonucleotide probes representing ~97% of the 3163 Open Reading Frames (ORFs) in the 2003 draft assembly of C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 were constructed as described earlier [Brown SD et al., Appl Biochem Biotechnol 2007 137-140(1-12); PMID: 18478424]. The probe sequences were later compared to the completed genome sequence using reciprocal BLAST analysis and assigned new ORF numbers. Based on the comparison, 79 probes which did not have any BLAST hits and 108 probes that only had partial hits to annotated ORFs in the closed genome were either excluded or marked-up during downstream data analysis.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical data analysis was conducted using JMP Genomics software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The array signal intensities were background-corrected, log2-transformed and data for duplicated probes on the arrays were averaged and normalized using the Data-Standardize method. Low-quality array data were discarded based on scatter plots, correlation coefficients, principal component analysis and other quality control criteria. One-way ANOVA analysis was conducted with the 6hr samples as the control at a False Discovery Rate of 2% (P-value &lt; 0.01) to identify differentially expressed genes of statistical significance. ANOVA analysis data are linked as a supplementary file on the Series record.

    <Summary>
Background: The ability of Clostridium thermocellum ATCC 27405 wild-type strain to hydrolyze cellulose and ferment the degradation products directly to ethanol and other metabolic byproducts makes it an attractive candidate for consolidated bioprocessing of cellulosic biomass to biofuels. In this study, whole-genome microarrays were used to investigate the expression of C. thermocellum mRNA during growth on crystalline cellulose in controlled replicate batch fermentations.
Results: A time-series analysis of gene expression revealed changes in transcript levels of ~40% of genes (~1300 out of 3198 ORFs encoded in the genome) during transition from early-exponential to late-stationary phase. K-means clustering of genes with statistically significant changes in transcript levels identified six distinct clusters of temporal expression. Broadly, genes involved in energy production, translation, glycolysis and amino acid, nucleotide and coenzyme metabolism displayed a decreasing trend in gene expression as cells entered stationary phase. In comparison, genes involved in cell structure and motility, chemotaxis, signal transduction and transcription showed an increasing trend in gene expression. Hierarchical clustering of cellulosome-related genes highlighted temporal changes in composition of this multi-enzyme complex during batch growth on crystalline cellulose, with increased expression of several genes encoding hydrolytic enzymes involved in degradation of non-cellulosic substrates in stationary phase.
Conclusions: Overall, the results suggest that under low substrate availability, growth slows due to decreased metabolic potential and C. thermocellum alters its gene expression to (i) modulate the composition of cellulosomes that are released into the environment with an increased proportion of enzymes than can efficiently degrade plant polysaccharides other than cellulose, (ii) enhance signal transduction and chemotaxis mechanisms perhaps to sense the oligo-saccharide hydrolysis products, and nutrient gradients generated through the action of cell-free cellulosomes and, (iii) increase cellular motility for potentially orienting the cells’ movement towards positive environmental signals leading to nutrient sources. Such a coordinated cellular strategy would increase its chances of survival in natural ecosystems where feast and famine conditions are frequently encountered.

    <Overall-Design>
Total RNA was extracted from the cell pellets and the reverse transcribed cDNA was hybridized to oligo-arrays containing duplicated probes representing ~90% of the annotated ORFs in C. thermocellum ATCC27405 genome.Dual-channel dye swap experimental design was used to analyze the time-course of gene expression during cellulose fermentation using two biological replicate fermentation. The 6hr sample as the reference, to which all other time-point samples (8, 10, 12, 14, 16hr) were compared.
