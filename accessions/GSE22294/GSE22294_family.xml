    <Data-Processing>
Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

1) For each sample harvest 2.0 OD600 units of bacterial culture (for example 4 ml of a culture with an OD600 of 0.5).  1a) For exponential and stationary phase cultures: prepare a 50 ml Falcon tube containing 1/4 of the culture volume of ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol. Add the appropriate volume of culture e.g. add 4 ml culture to 1 ml of phenol/ethanol. Stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  1b) For lag phase samples: add 187 ml ice-cold 5% (v/v) phenol pH 4.3, 95% (v/v) ethanol directly to the 750 ml lag phase culture volume. Mix well and stand on ice for at least 30 min but no longer than 2 hours to stabilise the RNA and prevent degradation.  2) Centrifuge samples at 3220 x g at 4°C for 10 min. Discard supernatant, resuspend bacterial pellets using residual liquid in tubes and transfer to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes.  3) Spin tubes 60 secs at maximum speed in a microfuge and discard remaining liquid.  4) Store pellets by freezing at -80°C. Pellets can be kept for up to 1 month before continuing with RNA prep.  5) Resuspend pellets in 100 μl TE buffer containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min.  6) Carry out RNA extraction using the SV Total RNA Purification kit (Promega; Z3100) following manufacturer's instructions, including the DNAse incubation step.  7) Elute RNA from the columns into 100 ul RNAse-free distilled water and allow to stand for 1 min before eluting at 4500 x g for 2 min.   8) Check the RNA concentration using a spectrophotometer and check for degradation using the Aligent Bioanalyzer.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

Feature extraction was carried out within BlueFuse forMicroarrays v3.1 following manufacturer's instructions. Raw data files were generated, which are attached. The raw data files were then post-processed using block-by-block median shifting within BlueFuse. This brought the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centred ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. All ratios were then transformed such that the ratios shown are relative to the inoculum (Inoc). For early timepoints (Inoc to 120 minutes), this involved dividing the normalised ratio for each replicate by the median of the Inoculum profiles from the same biological replicate; for later timepoints (ME to LSP), each replicate was divided by the median of all inoculum profiles. Data were processed for microarray features corresponding to Salmonella Typhimurium LT2 or SL1344 only.

The block-by-block median-shifted un-logged ratios showing expression relative to the 0 minute timepoint are available in 'GSE22294_ratios__relative_to_0min.txt', which is linked to the Series GSE22294 record as a supplementary file.

    <Pubmed-ID>22139505</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Transcriptional profiles during all phases of growth of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 were obtained and used to investigate growth phase-dependent alterations in gene expression. Viable count growth curve analysis of the growth system showed a culture lag time of 2.09 hours, and profiles at 4, 20, 40, 60, 90 and 120 minutes were measured accordingly. For comparison, profiles of the inoculum (0 min), mid-exponential (380 min), late-exponential (630 min), early-stationary (900 min) and late-stationary phase (2880 min) were also obtained. Large-scale gene-expression changes were seen, with substantial changes within 4 minutes of inoculation, indicating the speed and sophistication at which Salmonella senses its new environment during lag phase.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Timecourse; 46 samples (11 timepoints, each with two biological replicates and at least two technical replicates); each sample hybridised in a two-channel hybridization against Salmonella genomic DNA as the comparator/reference, which also acted as a control for spot quality.
