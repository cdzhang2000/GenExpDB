70 bp DNA oligonucleotides-based spotted array on glass slides. For full details of methodology contact Dr. Stephen Wilcox;

RNA conversion to cDNA and postlabelling with Cy3 and Cy5 was performed with the SuperScript Indirect cDNA Labeling System (Invitrogen).
Prehybridization was performed in hybrization solution (25% vol./vol. formamide, 5 X SSC buffer – 0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing 10 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 42°C. Slides were then rinsed twice in distilled water and air-dryed. Hybridisation was performed in a humid hybridisation chamber at 42°C for 16-20 h using a hybridisation solution containing 0.42 ug ul-1 human Cot1 DNA, 0.62 ug ul-1 polyA and 0.83 ug ul-1 salmon sperm DNA. Slides were washed at room temperature in 1 X SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min and again in 0.1 X SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min. The slides were then further washed twice in 0.1 X SSC buffer at room temperature for 2 min.  Slides were then dried and subsequently scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments).

Cells underwent a 2-3 hour (25°C) enzymatic treatment in TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 20 mg ml-1 lysozyme and 10 mg ml-1 proteinase K. Cells were fully lysed by bead beating using 0.1 mm zirconium-silica sand in RNAeasy MIDI RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) lysis buffer containing 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol. RNA was then extracted and purified using the RNAeasy kit and subsequently stored at -80°C. RNA quality was assessed with electrophoresis using a RNA bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies) with gels stained with picogreen and scanned with a laser. Electrophoretograms were assessed for intact 16S and 23S rRNA bands before progression to microarray hybridization.

Cells underwent a 2-3 hour (25°C) enzymatic treatment in TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 20 mg ml-1 lysozyme and 10 mg ml-1 proteinase K. Cells were fully lysed by bead beating using 0.1 mm zirconium-silica sand in RNAeasy MIDI RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) lysis buffer containing 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol. RNA was then extracted and purified using the RNAeasy kit and subsequently stored at -80°C. RNA quality was assessed with electrophoresis using a RNA bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies) with gels stained with picogreen and scanned with a laser. Electrophoretograms were assessed for intact 16S and 23S rRNA bands before progression to microarray hybridization.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Slides were pre-hybridised in a hybrisation solution (25% vol./vol. formamide, 5 x SSC buffer – 0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing 10 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 42°C. Slides were then rinsed twice in distilled water and air-dryed followed by gentle drying with an air gun. Hybridisation was performed in a humid hybridisation chamber at 42°C for 16-20 h using a hybridisation solution containing 0.42 ug ul-1 human Cot1 DNA, 0.62 ug ul-1 polyA and 0.83 ug ul-1 salmon sperm DNA. Slides were washed at room temperature in 1 X SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min and again in 0.1 x SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min. The slides were then further washed twice in 0.1 X SSC buffer at room temperature for 2 min. Slides were then dried by plate centrifugation (10 minutes, 1000xg, 550rpm) with then gently with an air gun.

Cells underwent a 2-3 hour (25°C) enzymatic treatment in TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 20 mg ml-1 lysozyme and 10 mg ml-1 proteinase K. Cells were fully lysed by bead beating using 0.1 mm zirconium-silica sand in RNAeasy MIDI RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) lysis buffer containing 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol. RNA was then extracted and purified using the RNAeasy kit and subsequently stored at -80°C. RNA quality was assessed with electrophoresis using a RNA bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies) with gels stained with picogreen and scanned with a laser. Electrophoretograms were assessed for intact 16S and 23S rRNA bands before progression to microarray hybridization.

Slides were pre-hybridised in a hybrisation solution (25% vol./vol. formamide, 5 x SSC buffer – 0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing 10 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 42°C. Slides were then rinsed twice in distilled water and air-dryed followed by gentle drying with an air gun. Hybridisation was performed in a humid hybridisation chamber at 42°C for 16-20 h using a hybridisation solution containing 0.42 ug ul-1 human Cot1 DNA, 0.62 ug ul-1 polyA and 0.83 ug ul-1 salmon sperm DNA. Slides were washed at room temperature in 1 X SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min and again in 0.1 x SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min. The slides were then further washed twice in 0.1 X SSC buffer at room temperature for 2 min. Slides were then dried by plate centrifugation (10 minutes, 1000xg, 550rpm) with then gently with an air gun.

Cells underwent a 2-3 hour (25°C) enzymatic treatment in TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl, 1 mM disodium EDTA, pH 7.5) containing 20 mg ml-1 lysozyme and 10 mg ml-1 proteinase K. Cells were fully lysed by bead beating using 0.1 mm zirconium-silica sand in RNAeasy MIDI RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) lysis buffer containing 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol. RNA was then extracted and purified using the RNAeasy kit and subsequently stored at -80°C. RNA quality was assessed with electrophoresis using a RNA bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies) with gels stained with picogreen and scanned with a laser. Electrophoretograms were assessed for intact 16S and 23S rRNA bands before progression to microarray hybridization.

Slides were pre-hybridised in a hybrisation solution (25% vol./vol. formamide, 5 x SSC buffer – 0.75 M NaCl, 0.075 M trisodium citrate, pH 7.0, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate) containing 10 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin for 45 min at 42°C. Slides were then rinsed twice in distilled water and air-dryed followed by gentle drying with an air gun. Hybridisation was performed in a humid hybridisation chamber at 42°C for 16-20 h using a hybridisation solution containing 0.42 ug ul-1 human Cot1 DNA, 0.62 ug ul-1 polyA and 0.83 ug ul-1 salmon sperm DNA. Slides were washed at room temperature in 1 X SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min and again in 0.1 x SSC buffer containing 0.2% SDS for 5 min. The slides were then further washed twice in 0.1 X SSC buffer at room temperature for 2 min. Slides were then dried by plate centrifugation (10 minutes, 1000xg, 550rpm) with then gently with an air gun.

    <Title>Differential gene expression of Listeria monocytogenes during high hydrostatic pressure processing</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE9179</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>18227250</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
High hydrostatic pressure processing (HPP) is currently being used as a treatment for certain foods to control the presence of food-borne pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes. Genomic microarray analysis was performed to determine the effects of HPP on L. monocytogenes in order to understand how it responds to mechanical stress injury. Reverse transcriptase PCR analysis of tufB and rpoC indicated that the reduction of mRNA expression in HPP treated cells was dependent on intensity and time of the treatment. Treatments of 400 and 600 MPa for 5 min. on cells in the exponential growth phase though leading to partial or complete cellular inactivation still resulted in measurable relative differential gene expression. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated HPP induced increased expression of genes associated with DNA repair mechanisms, transcription and translation protein complexes, the septal ring, the general protein translocase system, flagella assemblage and chemotaxis, and lipid and peptidoglycan biosynthetic pathways. HPP on the other hand appears to suppress a wide range of energy production and conversion, carbohydrate metabolism, and virulence associated genes accompanied by strong suppression of the SigB and PrfA regulons. HPP also induced repression of genes negatively controlled by pleotrophic regulator CodY. HPP-induced cellular damage appears to lead to increased expression of genes linked to sections of the cell previously shown in bacteria to be damaged or altered during HPP exposure and suppression of gene expression associated with cellular growth processes and virulence.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Two separate treatments were conducted one at 400 MPa (5 min) treatment with 3 biological replicates and a seond at 600 MPa (5 min) with 3 biological replicates compared. In the case of the 600 MPa (5 min) treatment two technical replicates per biological replicate were also included in the downstream data processing as mRNA levels were quite variable after this treatment as compared to the milder high pressure treatment.
