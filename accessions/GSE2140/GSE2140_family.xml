    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

    <Description>
This study examined the genes under the control of sigma32 in E. coli by moderate induction of a plasmid-borne rpoH gene under defined steady-state growth condition. Samples were taken from culture at mid log phase (OD=0.2) before or 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 15 minutes after induction. Samples were then RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent (Qiagen). Total RNA was then isolated using MasterPure kits (Epicentre Technologies). Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Arrays as recommended in the technical manual (www.affymetrix.com). Meanwhile, we measured the protein level of sigma32 during the time course. The changes of some sigma32?dependent genes were also determined in a DnaK null mutant to examine the anti-sigma function of the gene.
This sample is taken from pre-induction culture to serve as control (0 munites induction).

This study examined the genes under the control of sigma32 in E. coli by moderate induction of a plasmid-borne rpoH gene under defined steady-state growth condition. Samples were taken from culture at mid log phase (OD=0.2) before or 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 15 minutes after induction. Samples were then RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent (Qiagen). Total RNA was then isolated using MasterPure kits (Epicentre Technologies). Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Arrays as recommended in the technical manual (www.affymetrix.com). Meanwhile, we measured the protein level of sigma32 during the time course. The changes of some sigma32?dependent genes were also determined in a DnaK null mutant to examine the anti-sigma function of the gene.
This sample is taken from a seperate culture subject to 5 minutes induction by anhydrotetracycline.

This study examined the genes under the control of sigma32 in E. coli by moderate induction of a plasmid-borne rpoH gene under defined steady-state growth condition. Samples were taken from culture at mid log phase (OD=0.2) before or 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 15 minutes after induction. Samples were then RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent (Qiagen). Total RNA was then isolated using MasterPure kits (Epicentre Technologies). Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Arrays as recommended in the technical manual (www.affymetrix.com). Meanwhile, we measured the protein level of sigma32 during the time course. The changes of some sigma32?dependent genes were also determined in a DnaK null mutant to examine the anti-sigma function of the gene.
This sample is taken from a seperate culture subject to 10 minutes induction by anhydrotetracycline.

This study examined the genes under the control of sigma32 in E. coli by moderate induction of a plasmid-borne rpoH gene under defined steady-state growth condition. Samples were taken from culture at mid log phase (OD=0.2) before or 5 minutes, 10 minutes or 15 minutes after induction.

Purified RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA, labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Arrays as recommended in the technical manual (www.affymetrix.com). Meanwhile, we measured the protein level of sigma32 during the time course. The changes of some sigma32 –dependent genes were also determined in a DnaK null mutant to examine the anti- sigma32 function of DnaK.
