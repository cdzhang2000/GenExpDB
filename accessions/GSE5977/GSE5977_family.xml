    <Description>
The genome microarray consists of 4,750 70-mer oligonucleotides representing 4127 ORFs from Mycobacterium tuberculosis - reference strain H37Rv, and 623 unique ORFs from strain CDC1551 which are not present in the H37Rv strain's annotated gene complement. The full 70-mer complement is printed twice on the surface of the microarray. The microarray also contains 500 additional features which have been reserved for future use.

Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit.

    <Description>
The array hybridization was performed to compare general gene expression change between an exponential growth phase and late-log phase. Wild-type Mtb cells were directly inoculated from freezing stock until OD~0.5, which was chosen as a reference exponential growth stage. Samples were prepared after further growth until the OD values doubles in the same medium as was in the reference cells.

      <Growth-Protocol>
M. tuberculosis H37Rv was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 (supplemented with 0.05% Tween-80, 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment and 0.2% glycerol). RNA was extracted from cells growing exponentially at an optical density (A600) of approximately 0.5 in liquid Middlebrook 7H9 medium (pH7.0).

Cell was harvested and quickly frozen in dry ice-ethanol bath. Total RNA was isolated using galss beads (Bio1010, Lysing matrix B), a TRIzol (InVitrogen) extraction and RNease (Qiagen) purification according to the manufacturers' recommendations.

Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit.

The array hybridization was performed to compare general gene expression change between an exponential growth phase and late-log phase. Wild-type Mtb cells were inoculated and grown until OD~0.5, which is chosen as a reference exponential growth stage. Samples were prepared after further growth until the OD values doubles in teh same medium as was in the reference cells.

There is no specific stress factors applied for this sample in terms of O2, nutrient, temperature and pH. Cells were harvested based on the optical density.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
M. tuberculosis H37Rv was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 (supplemented with 0.05% Tween-80, 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment and 0.2% glycerol). RNA was extracted from cells growing exponentially at an optical density (A600) of approximately 0.5 in liquid Middlebrook 7H9 medium (pH7.0).

Cell was harvested and quickly frozen in dry ice-ethanol bath. Total RNA was isolated using glass beads (Bio101, LysingMatrix B), a TRIzol (InVitrogen) extraction and RNeasy (Qiagen) purification according to the manufacturers' recommendations.

      <Label>Cy3</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit.

    <Description>
The microarray hybridization was performed to compare general gene expression changes between an exponential growth phase and late-log phase. Wild-type Mtb cells were inoculated in the complete liquid medium, and grown until OD~0.5, which is chosen as a reference exponential growth stage. Samples were prepared after further growth until the OD values doubles in the same medium as was in the reference culture.

    <Title>Carboxyltransferase Subunit of the Acyl-CoA Carboxylase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.</Title>

    <Summary>
The Mycobacterium tuberculosis acyl-CoA carboxylases provide the building blocks for de novo fatty acid biosynthesis by fatty acid synthase (FAS) I and for the elongation of FAS I end-products by the FAS II complex to produce meromycolic acids. M. tuberculosis genome contains three biotin carboxylase subunits (AccA1-3) and 6 carboxyltransferase subunits (AccD1-6) of which AccD6 is located in a genetic locus that contains members of the FAS II complex. We found by microarray and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis that the transcripts of AccA3, AccD4, AccD5 and AccD6 are expressed at high levels during exponential growth phases of M. tuberculosis in vitro.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The microarray hybridization was performed to compare general gene expression changes along with Acyl-CoA carboxylase subunits between an exponential growth phase and late-log phase. Wild-type Mtb cells were inoculated in the complete liquid medium, and grown until OD~0.5, which is chosen as a reference exponential growth stage. Samples were prepared after further growth until the OD values doubles in the same medium as was in the reference culture.
