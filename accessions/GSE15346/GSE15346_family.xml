    <Manufacture-Protocol>
The sciTRACER S. aureus contains 2338 PCR products from all 2593 ORFs in the annotated genome (Ref ID: NC_002745), arranged in unique and second sequences: since the ORFs sizes range from 51 bp (e.g.: 13700427) up to 2kb (e.g.: 13701232), additional second PCR products have been developed. As unique sequences, 2333 PCR products and as second sequences, 333 PCR products are immobilized from which 5 are not in the group of unique gene fragments. All unique products cover 90 % of all ORFs. All PCR fragments are purified, concentration normalized, dissolved in spotting solution and spotted robotically onto modified glass slides. They are represented twice (duplicates) on each array. Controls are usually spotted in the last row of each subarray block forming the control area and comprising controls for spiking and endogenous controls. The SCIENION control set consists of positive, negative and multifunctional elements. All references/controls are spotted in a special pattern enabling functional monitoring of the entire experimental process. The glass slides are processed and ready for hybridization reaction. For easy correlation of gene names to their spot position on the slide the “Spot Identification Pattern-Table” (gal-file) is available. Information source: The genes represented on sciTRACER S. aureus are selected from order requests derived from the University of Würzburg, Infectious Biology Group (Head: Prof. Dr. Jörg Hacker) at the Institut für Molekulare Infektionsbiologie. Generation of sequences: 1. The PCR fragments derive mostly from regions at the last 500 nt from the 3’ end and have an average size of 355 bps. In case that the predicted ORF displayed a size unsuitable for appropriate amplicon generation, the primer design was extended towards flanking regions in order to cover the desired ORF. 2. All selected sequences are designed to provide the highest specificity and display minimal similarity to other mRNA and DNA sequences within the specified host genome. 3. In order to obtain strong and comparable sensitivity and signal specificity, all fragments are designed to feature similar lengths, comparable G/C-contents and optimized melting temperatures. 4. Based on algorithmic and manual revisions of the predicted sequences, the designed PCR fragments are well suited for the generation of highly reliable gene expression data. Quality controls: All sequences are validated in silico and approved by size control and sequence verification. The spot morphology is checked by automated optical control and hybridization of labeled RNA or SyBRGreenI® assay. Functional tests are performed by complex hybridization with labeled reference RNA for each batch. Source Organism: Staphylococcus aureus N 315 (NC_002745, contig BA000018) Microarray mapping: Each SCIENION microarray consists of two regions: the hybridizing region and the identifier region. The identifier region carries a sticker showing the name of the product, the date of production, batch number and the ID of the array. This region also serves to grasp the slide. The DNA microarray is in the center of the hybridizing region. Spot distance and feature size: The spot distance (center to center) is 375 µm. The array size is approximately 54 mm x 18 mm (height x broadness). Each array consists of 48 blocks and each block comprises 12 x 11 spots. These blocks are separated by a blank line and display a defined order. to Product description: The sciTRACER S. aureus contains 2338 PCR products from all 2593 ORFs in the annotated genome (Ref ID: NC_002745), arranged in unique and second sequences: since the ORFs sizes range from 51 bp (e.g.: 13700427) up to 2kb (e.g.: 13701232), additional second PCR products have been developed.

Total RNA was isolated from S. aureus cultures in exponential growth phase (OD600 of 1.0). Bacteria were harvested with addition of RNA Protect (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer`s instruction. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 x g, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml RLT-buffer and mechanically disrupted with glass beads in a Fast Prep shaker (Qbiogene, Heidelberg, Germany) two times for 45 s at a speed of 6.5 units. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 s at 13,000 x g, and the supernatant was used for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the standard QIAGEN RNeasy protocol. The isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase І (Roche, Penzberg, Germany), to remove DNA template. The integrity of RNA was monitored by analysis with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Only probes with a RNA integrity number (RIN) &gt;9 were used in further experiments.

Fluorescence-labeled single-stranded cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA. The RNA was isolated from cultures in the exponential growth phase at an OD600 of 1.0 at 37°C. 10 µg of total RNA from S. aureus NCTC 8325 wild type was used for reverse transcription with random primers and Superscript ІІІ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The integrity of RNA was analysed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The fluorescent labelling was performed during the RT reaction by incorporating the dye Cy3 according to the manufacture`s instruction (Scienion Berlin, Germany). Four different biological experiments were made, and a reverse labelling (dye switch) experiment was performed to minimize bias due to differential dye bleaching or incorporation of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes during the RT reaction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Microarray transcriptional profiling by competitive hybridization of fluorescence-labeled cDNA was performed using the custom PCR product full-genome chip sciTracer (Scienion, Berlin, Germany) containing 2666 unique open reading frames representing 90% of the S. aureus N315 genome (NC_002745). Additional information on the microarray platform is described elsewhere. To increase reproducibility, each experiment was performed 5 times including a dye swap resulting in five chips per competitive comparison. All hybridizations were done with equal amounts of fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes or picomols of dye. Fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes were mixed in hybridization buffer (Scienion) in a total volume of 55 µl and denatured at 95°C for 2 min and subsequently applied to the microarray slide following incubation at 42°C for 72 hours under humidified conditions according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hybridized microarrays were washed at room temperature in SSC buffer with decreasing salt concentrations (1 x SSC/0.3% SDS for 5 min, 0.2 x SSC for 5 min, 0.06 x SSC for 30s).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The intensity of fluorescence of the microarray was scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments/Distribution by Biozyme Scientific GmbH, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany). TIFF images were captured and analysed with GenePixPro4.1 software (Axon Instruments). The actual signal intensity was calculated by substracting the mean value of the local background intensity from the mean value of the signal intensity of the individual spot.

    <Description>
Staphylococcus aureus subsp. aureus strain NCTC 8325 wild type. This strain was originally used as a propagating strain for bacteriophage 47 of the international typing set of bacteriophages. This strain is generally considered to be the prototypical strain for most genetic research on S. aureus. Source DNA is available from www.narsa.net
S. aureus NCTC 8325 possesses 11-bp deletion in rsbU.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The data sets were then normalized by using Acuity 4.0 software (Axon Instruments) and by applying the LOWESS algorithm. Significant changes of gene expression were determined by implementing SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/; (Tusher, V. G., R. Tibshirani, and G. Chu. 2001. Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response. Proc.Natl.Acad.Sci.U.S.A 98:5116-5121.)) using the one class response and a false discovery rate of &lt; 1.5% with a medium number of falsely called significant genes of &lt;1.5.

Microarray transcriptional profiling by competitive hybridization of fluorescence-labeled cDNA was performed using the custom PCR product full-genome chip sciTracer (Scienion, Berlin, Germany) containing 2666 unique open reading frames representing 90% of the S. aureus N315 genome (NC_002745). Additional information on the microarray platform is described elsewhere. To increase reproducibility, each experiment was performed 5 times including a dye swap resulting in fiver chips per competitive comparison. All hybridizations were done with equal amounts of fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes or picomols of dye. Fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes were mixed in hybridization buffer (Scienion) in a total volume of 55 µl and denatured at 95°C for 2 min and subsequently applied to the microarray slide following incubation at 42°C for 72 hours under humidified conditions according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hybridized microarrays were washed at room temperature in SSC buffer with decreasing salt concentrations (1 x SSC/0.3% SDS for 5 min, 0.2 x SSC for 5 min, 0.06 x SSC for 30s).

Total RNA was isolated from S. aureus cultures in exponential growth phase (OD600 of 1.0). Bacteria were harvested with addition of RNA Protect (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer`s instruction. The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 x g, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml RLT-buffer and mechanically disrupted with glass beads in a Fast Prep shaker (Qbiogene, Heidelberg, Germany) two times for 45 s at a speed of 6.5 units. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 s at 13,000 x g, and the supernatant was used for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the standard QIAGEN RNeasy protocol. The isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase І (Roche, Penzberg, Germany), to remove DNA template. The integrity of RNA was monitored by analysis with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies).

The cells were centrifuged for 10 min at 5,000 x g, and the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml RLT-buffer and mechanically disrupted with glass beads in a Fast Prep shaker (Qbiogene, Heidelberg, Germany) two times for 45 s at a speed of 6.5 units. The cell lysate was centrifuged for 30 s at 13,000 x g, and the supernatant was used for RNA isolation. RNA was isolated using an RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN) according to the standard QIAGEN RNeasy protocol. The isolated RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase І (Roche, Penzberg, Germany), to remove DNA template. The integrity of RNA was monitored by analysis with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Only probes with a RNA integrity number (RIN) &gt;9 were used in further experiments.

Fluorescence-labeled single-stranded cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA. The RNA was isolated from cultures in the exponential growth phase at an OD600 of 1.0 at 37°C. 10 µg of total RNA from S. aureus NCTC 8325 wild type was used for reverse transcription with random primers and Superscript ІІІ reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The integrity of RNA was analysed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). The fluorescent labelling was performed during the RT reaction by incorporating the dye Cy3 according to the manufacture`s instruction (Scienion Berlin, Germany). Four different biological experiments were made, and a reverse labelling (dye switch) experiment was performed to minimize bias due to differential dye bleaching or incorporation of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes during the RT reaction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Microarray transcriptional profiling by competitive hybridization of fluorescence-labeled cDNA was performed using the custom PCR product full-genome chip sciTracer (Scienion, Berlin, Germany) containing 2666 unique open reading frames representing 90% of the S. aureus N315 genome (NC_002745). Additional information on the microarray platform is described elsewhere. To increase reproducibility, each experiment was performed 5 times including a dye swap resulting in five chips per competitive comparison. All hybridizations were done with equal amounts of fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes or picomols of dye. Fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes were mixed in hybridization buffer (Scienion) in a total volume of 55 µl and denatured at 95°C for 2 min and subsequently applied to the microarray slide following incubation at 42°C for 72 hours under humidified conditions according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Hybridized microarrays were washed at room temperature in SSC buffer with decreasing salt concentrations (1 x SSC/0.3% SDS for 5 min, 0.2 x SSC for 5 min, 0.06 x SSC for 30s).

    <Scan-Protocol>
The intensity of fluorescence of the microarray was scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments/Distribution by Biozyme Scientific GmbH, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany). TIFF images were captured and analysed with GenePixPro4.1 software (Axon Instruments). The actual signal intensity was calculated by substracting the mean value of the local background intensity from the mean value of the signal intensity of the individual spot.

The data sets were then normalized by using Acuity 4.0 software (Axon Instruments) and by applying the LOWESS algorithm. Significant changes of gene expression were determined by implementing SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/; (Tusher, V. G., R. Tibshirani, and G. Chu. 2001. Significance analysis of microarrays applied to the ionizing radiation response.

    <Pubmed-ID>19376851</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The function of the Staphylococcus aureus eukaryotic-like serine/threonine protein kinase PknB was investigated by transcriptome analysis using DNA-microarray technology and biochemical assays. The transcriptional profile reveals a strong regulatory impact of PknB on the expression of genes encoding proteins which are involved in purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, cell wall metabolism, autolysis, and glutamine synthesis.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
To investigate the functional role of PknB in S. aureus DNA microarray experiments were performed. In this experiment, the impact of the deletion of PknB was investigated. 
Each experiment was performed 5 times including a dye swap resulting in five chips per competitive comparison to increase reproducibility. All hybridizations were done with equal amounts of cDNA probes.
