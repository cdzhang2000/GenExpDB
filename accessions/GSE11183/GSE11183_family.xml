Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

A culture volume of 7ml was mixed with the same volume of boiling 2% SDS, 4mM EDTA and heated at 100°C for 3 to 5 minutes then vortexed. At this stage, the extract was either processed further or stored at -20°C.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The five bacterial strains (JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, JO3020 and MW30) were grown in 100ml LB 0.5% NaCl, M9 minimal glucose or M9 minimal glycerol at 200 rpm in New Brunswick laboratory shaker in 2liter flasks. The typical doubling time, observed in exponential phase in LB, was 40min for JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, MW30 and 75 min for JO3020. After growth curve calibration, the various growth phase sample were collected at the following cell densities: exponential phase: OD600 0.6-0.7; transition: 2.2-2.5 and stationary: 4.6-4.8 (3.0 for hupAB).

Seven mililiter of phenol/water were added before incubating 10 min at 67°C with occasional stirring. The samples were cooled on ice and spun 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted again once the same way and then once with phenol/chloroform (v/v 1:1). One tenth of the volume of 4M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol were then added to the aqueous phase. The tubes were left at -20°C for two hours then spun at 8500rpm at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum and resuspened in 300l sterile water and transferred to an eppendord tube. An amount of 34.5l Qiagen RDD buffer and 9.37l of RNase free DNase I (Qiagen) were added. After 15min at room temperature, the tubes were mixed by inversion and deproteinized as shown above with 300l phenol/H2O at room temperature. The RNA was then precipitated with 37.5µl NaCl 4M and 823µl cold ethanol. After 2 hours at -20°C, the tubes were centrifuged 30min at 10,000G at 4°C, the pellets were then washed with 70% ethanol then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 60µl sterile water. The RNAs were stored at -20°C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The five bacterial strains (JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, JO3020 and MW30) were grown in 100ml LB 0.5% NaCl, M9 minimal glucose or M9 minimal glycerol at 200 rpm in New Brunswick laboratory shaker in 2liter flasks. The typical doubling time, observed in exponential phase in LB, was 40min for JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, MW30 and 75 min for JO3020. After growth curve calibration, the various growth phase sample were collected at the following cell densities: exponential phase: OD600 0.6-0.7; transition: 2.2-2.5 and stationary: 4.6-4.8 (3.0 for hupAB).

Seven mililiter of phenol/water were added before incubating 10 min at 67°C with occasional stirring. The samples were cooled on ice and spun 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted again once the same way and then once with phenol/chloroform (v/v 1:1). One tenth of the volume of 4M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol were then added to the aqueous phase. The tubes were left at -20°C for two hours then spun at 8500rpm at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum and resuspened in 300l sterile water and transferred to an eppendord tube. An amount of 34.5l Qiagen RDD buffer and 9.37l of RNase free DNase I (Qiagen) were added. After 15min at room temperature, the tubes were mixed by inversion and deproteinized as shown above with 300l phenol/H2O at room temperature. The RNA was then precipitated with 37.5µl NaCl 4M and 823µl cold ethanol. After 2 hours at -20°C, the tubes were centrifuged 30min at 10,000G at 4°C, the pellets were then washed with 70% ethanol then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 60µl sterile water. The RNAs were stored at -20°C.

A culture volume of 7ml was mixed with the same volume of boiling 2% SDS, 4mM EDTA and heated at 100°C for 3 to 5 minutes then vortexed. At this stage, the extract was either processed further or stored at -20°C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The five bacterial strains (JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, JO3020 and MW30) were grown in 100ml LB 0.5% NaCl, M9 minimal glucose or M9 minimal glycerol at 200 rpm in New Brunswick laboratory shaker in 2liter flasks. The typical doubling time, observed in exponential phase in LB, was 40min for JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, MW30 and 75 min for JO3020. After growth curve calibration, the various growth phase sample were collected at the following cell densities: exponential phase: OD600 0.6-0.7; transition: 2.2-2.5 and stationary: 4.6-4.8 (3.0 for hupAB).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Seven mililiter of phenol/water were added before incubating 10 min at 67°C with occasional stirring. The samples were cooled on ice and spun 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted again once the same way and then once with phenol/chloroform (v/v 1:1). One tenth of the volume of 4M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol were then added to the aqueous phase. The tubes were left at -20°C for two hours then spun at 8500rpm at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum and resuspened in 300l sterile water and transferred to an eppendord tube. An amount of 34.5l Qiagen RDD buffer and 9.37l of RNase free DNase I (Qiagen) were added. After 15min at room temperature, the tubes were mixed by inversion and deproteinized as shown above with 300l phenol/H2O at room temperature. The RNA was then precipitated with 37.5µl NaCl 4M and 823µl cold ethanol. After 2 hours at -20°C, the tubes were centrifuged 30min at 10,000G at 4°C, the pellets were then washed with 70% ethanol then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 60µl sterile water. The RNAs were stored at -20°C.

After 15min at room temperature, the tubes were mixed by inversion and deproteinized as shown above with 300l phenol/H2O at room temperature. The RNA was then precipitated with 37.5µl NaCl 4M and 823µl cold ethanol. After 2 hours at -20°C, the tubes were centrifuged 30min at 10,000G at 4°C, the pellets were then washed with 70% ethanol then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 60µl sterile water. The RNAs were stored at -20°C.

A culture volume of 7ml was mixed with the same volume of boiling 2% SDS, 4mM EDTA and heated at 100°C for 3 to 5 minutes then vortexed. At this stage, the extract was either processed further or stored at -20°C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The five bacterial strains (JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, JO3020 and MW30) were grown in 100ml LB 0.5% NaCl, M9 minimal glucose or M9 minimal glycerol at 200 rpm in New Brunswick laboratory shaker in 2liter flasks. The typical doubling time, observed in exponential phase in LB, was 40min for JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, MW30 and 75 min for JO3020. After growth curve calibration, the various growth phase sample were collected at the following cell densities: exponential phase: OD600 0.6-0.7; transition: 2.2-2.5 and stationary: 4.6-4.8 (3.0 for hupAB).

Seven mililiter of phenol/water were added before incubating 10 min at 67°C with occasional stirring. The samples were cooled on ice and spun 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted again once the same way and then once with phenol/chloroform (v/v 1:1). One tenth of the volume of 4M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol were then added to the aqueous phase. The tubes were left at -20°C for two hours then spun at 8500rpm at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum and resuspened in 300l sterile water and transferred to an eppendord tube.

The five bacterial strains (JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, JO3020 and MW30) were grown in 100ml LB 0.5% NaCl, M9 minimal glucose or M9 minimal glycerol at 200 rpm in New Brunswick laboratory shaker in 2liter flasks. The typical doubling time, observed in exponential phase in LB, was 40min for JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, MW30 and 75 min for JO3020. After growth curve calibration, the various growth phase sample were collected at the following cell densities: exponential phase: OD600 0.6-0.7; transition: 2.2-2.5 and stationary: 4.6-4.8 (3.0 for hupAB).

Seven mililiter of phenol/water were added before incubating 10 min at 67°C with occasional stirring. The samples were cooled on ice and spun 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted again once the same way and then once with phenol/chloroform (v/v 1:1). One tenth of the volume of 4M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol were then added to the aqueous phase. The tubes were left at -20°C for two hours then spun at 8500rpm at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum and resuspened in 300l sterile water and transferred to an eppendord tube. An amount of 34.5l Qiagen RDD buffer and 9.37l of RNase free DNase I (Qiagen) were added. After 15min at room temperature, the tubes were mixed by inversion and deproteinized as shown above with 300l phenol/H2O at room temperature. The RNA was then precipitated with 37.5µl NaCl 4M and 823µl cold ethanol. After 2 hours at -20°C, the tubes were centrifuged 30min at 10,000G at 4°C, the pellets were then washed with 70% ethanol then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 60µl sterile water. The RNAs were stored at -20°C.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
A culture volume of 7ml was mixed with the same volume of boiling 2% SDS, 4mM EDTA and heated at 100°C for 3 to 5 minutes then vortexed. At this stage, the extract was either processed further or stored at -20°C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The five bacterial strains (JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, JO3020 and MW30) were grown in 100ml LB 0.5% NaCl, M9 minimal glucose or M9 minimal glycerol at 200 rpm in New Brunswick laboratory shaker in 2liter flasks. The typical doubling time, observed in exponential phase in LB, was 40min for JO2057, JO2081, JO2083, MW30 and 75 min for JO3020. After growth curve calibration, the various growth phase sample were collected at the following cell densities: exponential phase: OD600 0.6-0.7; transition: 2.2-2.5 and stationary: 4.6-4.8 (3.0 for hupAB).

Seven mililiter of phenol/water were added before incubating 10 min at 67°C with occasional stirring. The samples were cooled on ice and spun 10 min at 5000 rpm at 4°C. The aqueous phase was separated and extracted again once the same way and then once with phenol/chloroform (v/v 1:1). One tenth of the volume of 4M NaCl and 2.5 volumes of cold ethanol were then added to the aqueous phase. The tubes were left at -20°C for two hours then spun at 8500rpm at 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum and resuspened in 300l sterile water and transferred to an eppendord tube. An amount of 34.5l Qiagen RDD buffer and 9.37l of RNase free DNase I (Qiagen) were added. After 15min at room temperature, the tubes were mixed by inversion and deproteinized as shown above with 300l phenol/H2O at room temperature. The RNA was then precipitated with 37.5µl NaCl 4M and 823µl cold ethanol. After 2 hours at -20°C, the tubes were centrifuged 30min at 10,000G at 4°C, the pellets were then washed with 70% ethanol then dried under vacuum and resuspended in 60µl sterile water. The RNAs were stored at -20°C.

    <Title>Identification of the Escherichia coli HU regulon</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE11183</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19194530</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The physiological role of the various nucleoid-associated proteins in bacteria and HU in particular has been addressed in a number of studies but remains so far not fully understood. In this work, a genome-wide microarray hybridization approach, combined with in vivo genetic experimentation, has been performed in order to compare and evaluate the effect of HUalpha, HUbeta and HUalphabeta on the transcription of the Escherichia coli K12 genes as a function of growth phase.

The histone-like protein HU is present in the E. coli cell under three dimeric forms (HUalphabeta, HUalpha2 and HUbeta2) in a ratio that varies with growth phase. The experimental protocol is designed to handle strain genotype and growth phase as independent variables.
Keywords: genotype, growth phase
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We used microarrays to investigate global bacterial gene expression in five genotypes of E. coli C600: WT (JO2057), hupA (JO2081), hupB (JO2083), hupAB (JO3020) and rpoS (MW30) at three growth growth phases: exponential, transition and stationary and in three growth media: LB, M9 minimal Glucose and M9 minimal Glycerol. The most relevant experiments were carried out in duplicate: the wild type (JO2057) and the hupAB (JO3020) strains were tested in the exponential and stationary phase, in LB. Wild type and hupAB strains were also tested in single experiments at the transition phase in LB. The single hupA (JO2081) and single hupB (JO2083) mutants were tested at the three growth phases in LB. Wild type and hupAB strains were compared in single experiments both in M9 Minimal Glucose and M9 Minimal Glycerol at the exponential and stationary phase. The last chips were used to test respectively the rpoS mutant at the at the exponential and stationary phase in LB.
