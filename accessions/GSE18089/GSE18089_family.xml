Using the transcriptome of Salmonella Typhimurium LT2, an oligonucleotide microarray, made up of 43-45 mers, was designed. We choose 1152 genes, that were selected based upon their being associated with virulence or with regulation of virulence genes. Specifications of oligos were based upon various design characteristics such as temperature of melting, 3’ location, specificity, lack of repeat nucleotides, and other consideration as previously described. Oligos were synthesized and normalized in concentration by Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (Coralville, IA). Oligos were resuspended in Epoxide Slide Spotting Solution and printed onto Epoxide Coated Slides (Corning Inc., Corning, NY) using a GeneMachine’s Omnigrid Accent microarray printer (Genomic Solutions Ann Arbor, MI). Each array also contains duplicate elements for each gene.

Isolated from heart and liver from 4-week-old chickens.
Analyses were performed using Acuity 4.0 software.  Slides were normalized using standard settings (ratio based so that the mean of the ratio of means, of all features, were equal to 1.0).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
All spots were manually evaluated, and bad, low signal, absent, or unfound features were not included.  To obtain the final data provided, it was required that elements on each array and on each dye-swap (after mathematical conversion x’ = -x) provided agreement and showed statistically significant similarity, based upon a student t-test, at the p &lt; 0.05 level.  Genes were included in the final dataset that exhibit at least 2.0 fold regulations.

Isolated from pools of heart and liver from 4-week-old chickens
Analyses were performed using Acuity 4.0 software.  Slides were normalized using standard settings (ratio based so that the mean of the ratio of means, of all features, were equal to 1.0).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
All spots were manually evaluated, and bad, low signal, absent, or unfound features were not included.  To obtain the final data provided, it was required that elements on each array and on each dye-swap (after mathematical conversion x’ = -x) provided agreement and showed statistically significant similarity, based upon a student t-test, at the p &lt; 0.05 level.  Genes were included in the final dataset that exhibit at least 2.0 fold regulations.

    <Title>Influence of Microbial and Host Cell Sublethal Heat Stress on S. Typhimurium Gene Expression </Title>

    <Summary>
Environmental stress contributes to the outcome of infection by impacting both microbial virulence and host susceptibility to infection.  Thermal processing, commonly used for decontamination of poultry in the food industry, may elicit sublethal stress on resistant serovars of Salmonella. We employed traditional heat shock temperatures (42 and 48ºC), similar to avian body temperature and poultry processing conditions, to study gene expression of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Microarray analysis indicated that thermal shock at 42°C and 48°C induced expression of SPI-2 and SPI-5 genes, whose products are required for adhesion and survival.   However, SPI-1 genes, responsible for invasion of Salmonella into host cells, were down-regulated following exposure to 42°C and 48°C.  Bacterial adhesion assays showed greater adhesion of heat-stressed S. Typhimurium to Caco-2 cells compared to non-stressed bacteria.  In addition, subjecting Caco-2 cells to mild heat shock (39°C), which is similar to human fever, enhanced host cell susceptibility to bacterial adhesion.  Data indicate that thermal stress enhances bacterial colonization and host cell susceptibility to adhesion during S. Typhimurium infection.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Several different hurdles methods are used in the food industry to combat foodborne pathogens on meat surfaces. One of these methods is thermal treatment. The objective of our study was to test the effect of heat stress on the gene expression of Salmonella. We tested traditional heat shock temperatures (42 and 48ºC), similar to avian body temperature and poultry processing conditions for this study. We grew the Salmonella at 30 ºC overnight. After this, we transferred to fresh media and grew the cells to mid-log phase.  The cells were then subjected to heat shock and gene expression analysis using microarrays was carried out. We found an induced gene expression profile of genes involved in adhesion and repression in genes involved in invasion. We followed up this study by tissue culture analysis to test if heat stressed Salmonella adhere better to intestinal Caco-2 cells and found that there was increased adhesion but decreased invasion.
