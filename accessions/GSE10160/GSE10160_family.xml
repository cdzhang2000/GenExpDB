Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Antibiotics were added to final concentration of 10 ug/ml cefsulodin and 0.03 ug/ml mecillinam when the culture reached an OD of approximately 0.2.  In the case of the combination treatment the same concentrations were used but the antibiotics were measured and mixed prior to addition.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures of MG1655 were grown overnight at 37°C for 14-16 hours Cultures of SEA113 (MG1655) were grown in LB at 37°C overnight (14-18 hrs) with rotation.  The overnight cultures were diluted in fresh media to an OD600 of 0.02 and grown at 37°C with shaking in a gyrotary water bath until an OD600 of 0.2, at which point antibiotics were added.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Samples were collected from both the treated and untreated cultures 5 minutes before treatment as well as 5, 20 and 40 minutes after treatment.  The 40 minute time point was immediately before cell growth slowed due to antibiotic treatment. 10 ml of culture was added to an ice-cold 5% phenol/ethanol solution to stop further transcription.  RNA was extracted using the hot phenol method of extraction.

Antibiotics were added to final concentration of 10 ug/ml cefsulodin and 0.03 ug/ml mecillinam when the culture reached an OD of approximately 0.2.  In the case of the combination treatment the same concentrations were used but the antibiotics were measured and mixed prior to addition.

Cultures of MG1655 were grown overnight at 37°C for 14-16 hours Cultures of SEA113 (MG1655) were grown in LB at 37°C overnight (14-18 hrs) with rotation.  The overnight cultures were diluted in fresh media to an OD600 of 0.02 and grown at 37°C with shaking in a gyrotary water bath until an OD600 of 0.2, at which point antibiotics were added.

Cultures of MG1655 were grown overnight at 37°C for 14-16 hours Cultures of SEA113 (MG1655) were grown in LB at 37°C overnight (14-18 hrs) with rotation.  The overnight cultures were diluted in fresh media to an OD600 of 0.02 and grown at 37°C with shaking in a gyrotary water bath until an OD600 of 0.2, at which point antibiotics were added.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures of MG1655 were grown overnight at 37°C for 14-16 hours Cultures of SEA113 (MG1655) were grown in LB at 37°C overnight (14-18 hrs) with rotation.  The overnight cultures were diluted in fresh media to an OD600 of 0.02 and grown at 37°C with shaking in a gyrotary water bath until an OD600 of 0.2, at which point antibiotics were added.

Samples were collected from both the treated and untreated cultures 5 minutes before treatment as well as 5, 20 and 40 minutes after treatment.  The 40 minute time point was immediately before cell growth slowed due to antibiotic treatment. 10 ml of culture was added to an ice-cold 5% phenol/ethanol solution to stop further transcription.  RNA was extracted using the hot phenol method of extraction.

Gene expression data from E. coli cells treated with 10 ug/ml cefsulodin and 0.03 ug/ml mecillinam
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with the robust multichip averaging (RMA) program in the Simpleaffy package for the Bioconductor statistics environment.  Genes with significant changes in gene expression were identified using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) program using two-way paired comparison with a false discovery rate of 0.958 % for cef/mec.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Antibiotics were added to final concentration of 10 ug/ml cefsulodin and 0.03 ug/ml mecillinam when the culture reached an OD of approximately 0.2.  In the case of the combination treatment the same concentrations were used but the antibiotics were measured and mixed prior to addition.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures of MG1655 were grown overnight at 37°C for 14-16 hours Cultures of SEA113 (MG1655) were grown in LB at 37°C overnight (14-18 hrs) with rotation.  The overnight cultures were diluted in fresh media to an OD600 of 0.02 and grown at 37°C with shaking in a gyrotary water bath until an OD600 of 0.2, at which point antibiotics were added.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Samples were collected from both the treated and untreated cultures 5 minutes before treatment as well as 5, 20 and 40 minutes after treatment.  The 40 minute time point was immediately before cell growth slowed due to antibiotic treatment. 10 ml of culture was added to an ice-cold 5% phenol/ethanol solution to stop further transcription.  RNA was extracted using the hot phenol method of extraction.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Antibiotics were added to the final concentrations of 60 ug/ml cefsulodin, 0.3 ug/ml mecillinam, or the combination of 10 ug/ml cefsulodin and 0.03 ug/ml mecillinam when the culture reached an OD of approximately 0.2.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures of MG1655 were grown overnight at 37°C for 14-16 hours Cultures of SEA113 (MG1655) were grown in LB at 37°C overnight (14-18 hrs) with rotation.  The overnight cultures were diluted in fresh media to an OD600 of 0.02 and grown at 37°C with shaking in a gyratory water bath until an OD600 of 0.2, at which point antibiotics were added.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Samples were collected from both the treated and untreated cultures at time points immediately before cell growth slowed due to antibiotic treatment (40 min. after treatment with a combination of cefsulodin and mecillinam, 10 min. after cefsulodin treatment, and 60 min. after mecillinam treatment), and added to an ice-cold 5% phenol/ethanol solution to stop further transcription.  RNA was extracted using the hot phenol method of extraction.

    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with the robust multichip averaging (RMA) program in the Simpleaffy package for the Bioconductor statistics environment.  Genes with significant changes in gene expression were identified using the significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) program using two-way paired comparison with false discovery rates of 0.828% for mecillinam and 1.67% for cefsulodin.

    <Summary>
Gram-negative bacteria possess stress responses to maintain the integrity of the cell envelope.  Stress sensors monitor outer membrane permeability, envelope protein folding, and energization of the inner membrane.  The systems used by Gram-negative bacteria to sense and combat stress resulting from disruption of the peptidoglycan layer are not well characterized.  The peptidoglycan layer is a single molecule that completely surrounds the cell and ensures its structural integrity.  During cell growth new peptidoglcyan subunits are incorporated into the peptidoglycan layer by a series of enzymes called the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).  To explore how Gram-negative bacteria respond to peptidoglycan stress, global gene expression analysis was used to identify Escherichia coli stress responses activated following inhibition of specific PBPs by the β-lactam antibiotics mecillinam and cefsulodin.  Inhibition of PBPs with different roles in peptidoglycan synthesis has different consequences for cell morphology and viability, suggesting that not all perturbations to the peptidoglycan layer generate equivalent stresses.  We demonstrate that inhibition of different PBPs resulted in both shared and unique stress responses.  The regulation of capsular synthesis (Rcs) phosphorelay was activated by inhibition of all of the PBPs tested.  Furthermore, we show that activation of the Rcs phosphorelay increased survival in the presence of these antibiotics, independently of capsule synthesis.  Both activation of the phosphorelay and survival required signal transduction via the outer membrane lipoprotein RcsF and the response regulator RcsB.  We propose that the Rcs pathway responds to peptidoglycan damage and contributes to the intrinsic resistance of E. coli to β-lactam antibiotics.
We used microarrays to identify changes in gene expression resulting from treatment of Escherichia coli with the β-lactam antibiotics cefsulodin, mecillinam, or the combination.
