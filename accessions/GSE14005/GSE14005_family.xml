    <Manufacture-Protocol>
The version 1.1 Mtb 70-mer oligo library was used.  It contains a totall of 4320 70-mers, including targets for 3,924 ORFs annotated for strain H37Rv by Sanger plus an additional 371 ORFs from strain CDC1551 (TIGER) with less than 97% homology to H37Rv.  Oligos are Tm normalized to 79C +/- 5 degrees C.  Negative controls are 25 randomized 70-mers.  Positive control - mix of 4295 Mtb specific 70-mers.  Oligos were spotted using a Genomic Solutions (previously BioRobotics), MicroGrid Pro arrayer equipped with Micro-Spot 2500 pins (BioRobotics) onto Corning UltraGap slides. Each target wass spotted in duplicate  After spotting slides were UV irradiated at 200 milli-Joules in a BioRad UV box and then baked  for 1-2 hours at 85C.  They were then washed with 1%SDS for 2 minutes, then 2X Milli-Q water wash, dunk in 100% ethanol for 10 seconds and dried by centrifugation at 600RPM for 3 minutes.

For isolation of RNA GTC lysis/stabilization buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% Na N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM sodium citrate, and 0.1M beta-mercaptoethanol) was added, and pelleted Mtb were washed and then digested with lysozyme. TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added, and organisms were disrupted using glass beads in a Mini-Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc. Bartlesville, OK). After extraction of Mtb lysates with chloroform, ethanol was added to the aqueous phase before loading samples onto RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Subsequent steps were then performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following elution with RNase-free water, the RNA samples were treated with DNase (Turbo DNAfree, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stored at -70oC until analysis.

      <Label-Protocol>
Using the MessageAmpTM-II Bacteria RNA Amplification system (Ambion), we amplified 100-250 ng total RNA to generate sufficient RNA from mycobacteria for microarray hybrization. Briefly, total bacterial RNA was first polyadenylated by E. coli poly(A) polymerase. Using an oligo(dT) primer that incorporated a T7 promoter, poly(A) tailed RNA was reverse transcribed to yield double-stranded cDNA. The resulting cDNA served as the template for in vitro transcription (IVT) by T7 RNA polymerase which generates multiple antisense RNA (aRNA) copies of each transcript in the sample. Amino-allyl UTP was incorporated into aRNA during the IVT reaction to permit fluorophore post-labeling. amino-allyl modified aRNA were labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) and purified using a MegaClear kit (Ambion).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Whole lung surfactant (WLS) was obtained by centrifugation of lavage fluid (0.15M NaCl) from the intact lungs of freshly killed calves (ONY, Inc, Amherst, NY). Centrifugation was done at 12,000 x g at room temperature to pellet the active large aggregate surfactant fraction. To determine the effects of WLS on the transcriptional response of Mtb, WLS in 650 µl PBS was coated onto the bottom surface of a 25 cm2 cell culture flask for 30 min at 37oC to mimic a surfactant layer. Mtb was added to the flask in 3.35 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 5 mM HEPES) and exposed to coated surfactant for 2h at 37oC.  Three independent biological replicates were studied.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
5-10 ug of Alexa-labeled aRNA from paired samples was dried using a Speedvac and resuspended in 50 ul of hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 25 g salmon sperm DNA). Samples were denatured at 95oC for 5 min and briefly cooled to 60oC before being applied to arrays under a glass LifterSlip (Erie Scientific). Slides were prehybridized for 1 hr in 25% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Labeled targets were hybridized to microarrays in humidified slide chambers (Corning) at 45oC for 16-18 hr. Arrays were washed sequentially with buffer 1 (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) pre-warmed to 45oC, buffer 2 (0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS), buffer 3 (0.2X SSC), and buffer 4 (0.05X SSC). Slides were briefly dipped in de-ionized ultrafiltered water before being dried by centrifugation (700 X g, 10 min).

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned with a GenePix 4000B instrument (Axon Instruments, Inc.) with preliminary image analysis, spot intensity determination, background measurements, spot quality assessment and flagging conducted using Imagene software (version 6.0, Biodiscovery). PMT levels for scanning were set to equalize signal intensity of positive control spots and minimize saturated spots.

    <Data-Processing>
Preliminary image analysis, spot intensity determination, background measurements, spot quality assessment and flagging conducted using Imagene software (version 6.0, Biodiscovery). Poor quality spots with signal intensities less than three standard deviations above background were excluded from further analysis. Subsequent normalization, statistical analysis, and visualization of array data were performed with Genespring 7.3 (Agilent). Lowess normalization was used, Genespring Cross-Gene error model was activated. Genes with significant changes in expression levels relative to controls were identified based on fold change (1.5-fold) and reproducibility between replicates (p-value &lt;0.05).

      <Growth-Protocol>
Mtb was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) supplemented with OADC enrichment (Difco),  Tween 80 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), and glycerol at 37oC to an A600 ~0.7 under static conditions.  Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3,000 rpm) at room temperature, resuspended in DMEM with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 5 mM HEPES and syringed to break clumps of Mtb.

For isolation of RNA GTC lysis/stabilization buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% Na N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM sodium citrate, and 0.1M mercaptoethanol) was added, and pelleted Mtb were washed and then digested with lysozyme. TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added, and organisms were disrupted using glass beads in a Mini-Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc. Bartlesville, OK). After extraction of Mtb lysates with chloroform, ethanol was added to the aqueous phase before loading samples onto Qiagen RNeasy mini columns. Subsequent steps were then performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following elution with RNase-free water, the RNA samples were treated with DNase (Turbo DNAfree, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stored at -70oC until analysis

      <Label-Protocol>
Using the MessageAmpTM-II Bacteria RNA Amplification system (Ambion), we amplified 100-250 ng total RNA to generate sufficient RNA from mycobacteria isolated from infected MØ for microarray hybrization. Briefly, total bacterial RNA was first polyadenylated by E. coli poly(A) polymerase. Using an oligo(dT) primer that incorporated a T7 promoter, poly(A) tailed RNA was reverse transcribed to yield double-stranded cDNA. The resulting cDNA served as the template for in vitro transcription (IVT) by T7 RNA polymerase which generates multiple antisense RNA (aRNA) copies of each transcript in the sample. Amino-allyl UTP was incorporated into aRNA during the IVT reaction to permit fluorophore post-labeling. amino-allyl modified aRNA were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) and purified using a MegaClear kit (Ambion).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Calf lung surfactant extract (CLSE) was prepared by extraction of WLS into chloroform-methanol by the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959), as described in our prior work (Hall SB et al. 1994). CLSE is conceptually identical to the substance of the clinical surfactant Infasurf® (Hudak ML et al. 1997). The composition of CLSE by weight was approximately 94% phospholipid, 4.5% cholesterol, and 1.5% protein (a mixture of SP-B and SP-C) as defined previously (Notter RH et al. 2002).
To determine the effects ofCLSE on the transcriptional response of Mtb, CLSE in 650 µl PBS was initially coated onto the bottom surface of a 25 cm2 cell culture flask for 30 min at 37oC to mimic a surfactant layer. Mtb was added to the flask in 3.35 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 5 mM HEPES) and exposed to coated surfactant for 2h at 37oC.  Two independent biological replicates were studied

As a control 650 ul PBS were left on the bottom surface of a 25 cm2 cell culture flask for 2h at 37oC. Mtb was added to the flask in 3.35 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 5 mM HEPES) and exposed to PBS control for 2h at 37oC. Two independent biological replicates were studied.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Mtb was grown in Middlebrook 7H9 broth (Difco, Detroit, Mich.) supplemented with OADC enrichment (Difco),  Tween 80 (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo.), and glycerol at 37oC to an A600 ~0.7 under static conditions.  Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (10 min, 3,000 rpm) at room temperature, resuspended in DMEM with 2% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 5 mM HEPES and syringed to break clumps of Mtb.

For isolation of RNA GTC lysis/stabilization buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% Na N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM sodium citrate, and 0.1M mercaptoethanol) was added, and pelleted Mtb were washed and then digested with lysozyme (Rohde et al. 2008). TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added, and organisms were disrupted using glass beads in a Mini-Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc. Bartlesville, OK). After extraction of Mtb lysates with chloroform, ethanol was added to the aqueous phase before loading samples onto Qiagen RNeasy mini columns. Subsequent steps were then performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following elution with RNase-free water, the RNA samples were treated with DNase (Turbo DNAfree, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stored at -70oC until analysis.

Using the MessageAmpTM-II Bacteria RNA Amplification system (Ambion), we amplified 100-250 ng total RNA to generate sufficient RNA from mycobacteria isolated from infected MØ for microarray hybrization. Briefly, total bacterial RNA was first polyadenylated by E. coli poly(A) polymerase. Using an oligo(dT) primer that incorporated a T7 promoter, poly(A) tailed RNA was reverse transcribed to yield double-stranded cDNA. The resulting cDNA served as the template for in vitro transcription (IVT) by T7 RNA polymerase which generates multiple antisense RNA (aRNA) copies of each transcript in the sample. Amino-allyl UTP was incorporated into aRNA during the IVT reaction to permit fluorophore post-labeling. amino-allyl modified aRNA were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) and purified using a MegaClear kit (Ambion).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Mixed lung surfactant phospholipids (PPL) were isolated from CLSE by column chromatography with an elution solvent of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform-methanol plus 5% 0.1 N HCl [57]. Two passes through a Sephadex LH-20 column (Pharmacia-LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ) separated phospholipids away from hydrophobic surfactant apoproteins and neutral lipids (Notter et al. 2002). Acid remaining in PPL fractions was removed by a second chloroform-methanol extraction. Final PPL had a protein content below the limits of detection of both the Folin-phenol assay of Lowry et al.(1951) and the amido black assay of Kaplin and Pedersen (1989), modified by the addition of 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to allow accurate quantitation in the presence of lipid.
To determine the effects of PPL on the transcriptional response of Mtb, PPL in 650 µl PBS was initially coated onto the bottom surface of a 25 cm2 cell culture flask for 30 min at 37oC to mimic a surfactant layer. Mtb was added to the flask in 3.35 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 5 mM HEPES) and exposed to coated surfactant for 2h at 37oC.  Amounts of PPL used per experiment were 3.3 mg in a total volume of 4 ml.  Two independent biological replicates were studied

5-10 ug of Cy-labeled cDNA or Alexa-labeled aRNA from paired samples was dried using a Speedvac and resuspended in 50 ul of hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS, and 25 g salmon sperm DNA). Samples were denatured at 95oC for 5 min and briefly cooled to 60oC before being applied to arrays under a glass LifterSlip (Erie Scientific). Slides were prehybridized for 1 hr in 25% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Labeled targets were hybridized to microarrays in humidified slide chambers (Corning) at 45oC for 16-18 hr. Arrays were washed sequentially with buffer 1 (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) pre-warmed to 45oC, buffer 2 (0.2X SSC, 0.1% SDS), buffer 3 (0.2X SSC), and buffer 4 (0.05X SSC). Slides were briefly dipped in de-ionized ultrafiltered water before being dried by centrifugation (700 X g, 10 min).

Preliminary image analysis, spot intensity determination, background measurements, spot quality assessment and flagging conducted using Imagene software (version 6.0, Biodiscovery). Poor quality spots with signal intensities less than three standard deviations above background were excluded from further analysis. Subsequent normalization, statistical analysis, and visualization of array data were performed with Genespring 7.3 (Agilent). Lowess normalization was used, Genespring Cross-Gene error model was activated. Genes with significant changes in expression levels relative to controls were identified based on fold change (1.5-fold) and reproducibility between replicates (p-value &lt;0.05).

For isolation of RNA GTC lysis/stabilization buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 0.5% Na N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM sodium citrate, and 0.1M mercaptoethanol) was added, and pelleted Mtb were washed and then digested with lysozyme (Rohde et al. 2008). TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added, and organisms were disrupted using glass beads in a Mini-Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc. Bartlesville, OK). After extraction of Mtb lysates with chloroform, ethanol was added to the aqueous phase before loading samples onto Qiagen RNeasy mini columns. Subsequent steps were then performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Following elution with RNase-free water, the RNA samples were treated with DNase (Turbo DNAfree, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stored at -70oC until analysis.

      <Label-Protocol>
Using the MessageAmpTM-II Bacteria RNA Amplification system (Ambion), we amplified 100-250 ng total RNA to generate sufficient RNA from mycobacteria isolated from infected MØ for microarray hybrization. Briefly, total bacterial RNA was first polyadenylated by E. coli poly(A) polymerase. Using an oligo(dT) primer that incorporated a T7 promoter, poly(A) tailed RNA was reverse transcribed to yield double-stranded cDNA. The resulting cDNA served as the template for in vitro transcription (IVT) by T7 RNA polymerase which generates multiple antisense RNA (aRNA) copies of each transcript in the sample. Amino-allyl UTP was incorporated into aRNA during the IVT reaction to permit fluorophore post-labeling. amino-allyl modified aRNA were labeled with Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) and purified using a MegaClear kit (Ambion).

Purified human SP-A was also examined for its effects on Mtb transcription, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a “no treatment” control. Human SP-A was a gift from Dr. J. R. Wright at Duke University, and was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with alveolar proteinosis as described previously (Wright et al. 1987).  In experiments with SP-A (in 650 µl PBS), the pure apoprotein was pre-coated on the flask as done with the surfactant preparations. Mtb was added to the flask in 3.35 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 5 mM HEPES) and exposed to coated SP-A for 2h at 37oC.   SP-A was studied at a level of 0.165 mg in a total volume of 4 ml based on its putative concentration of approximately 5% in endogenous surfactant.  Two independent biological replicates were studied.

Poor quality spots with signal intensities less than three standard deviations above background were excluded from further analysis. Subsequent normalization, statistical analysis, and visualization of array data were performed with Genespring 7.3 (Agilent). Lowess normalization was used, Genespring Cross-Gene error model was activated. Genes with significant changes in expression levels relative to controls were identified based on fold change (1.5-fold) and reproducibility between replicates (p-value &lt;0.05).

    <Pubmed-ID>19272305</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
This study uses microarray analyses to examine gene expression profiles for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) induced by exposure in vitro to bovine lung surfactant preparations that vary in apoprotein content: (i) whole lung surfactant (WLS) containing the complete mix of endogenous lipids and surfactant proteins (SP)-A, -B, -C, and -D; (ii) extracted lung surfactant (CLSE) containing lipids plus SP-B and -C; (iii) column-purified surfactant lipids (PPL) containing no apoproteins, and (iv) purified human SP-A. Exposure to WLS evoked a multitude of transcriptional responses in Mtb, with 52 genes up-regulated and 23 genes down-regulated at 30 min exposure, plus 146 genes up-regulated and 27 genes down-regulated at 2 h.  Notably, WLS rapidly induced several membrane-associated lipases that presumptively act on surfactant lipids as substrates, and a large number of genes involved in the synthesis of phthiocerol dimycocerosate (PDIM), a cell wall component known to be important in macrophage interactions and Mtb virulence. Exposure of Mtb to CLSE, PPL, or purified SP-A caused a substantially weaker transcriptional response (≤ 20 genes were induced) suggesting that interactions among multiple lipid-protein components of WLS may contribute to its effects on Mtb transcription. 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Whole lung surfactant (WLS) was obtained by centrifugation of lavage fluid (0.15M NaCl) from the intact lungs of freshly killed calves (ONY, Inc, Amherst, NY). Centrifugation was done at 12,000 x g at room temperature to pellet the active large aggregate surfactant fraction. CLSE was prepared by extraction of WLS into chloroform-methanol by the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959), as described in our prior work (Notter et al. 2002). CLSE is conceptually identical to the substance of the clinical surfactant Infasurf®. The composition of CLSE by weight was approximately 94% phospholipid, 4.5% cholesterol, and 1.5% protein (a mixture of SP-B and SP-C) as defined previously (Notter et al. 2002). Mixed lung surfactant phospholipids (PPL) were isolated from CLSE by column chromatography with an elution solvent of 1:1 (v/v) chloroform-methanol plus 5% 0.1 N HCl. Two passes through a Sephadex LH-20 column (Pharmacia-LKB Biotechnology, Piscataway, NJ) separated phospholipids away from hydrophobic surfactant apoproteins and neutral lipids. Acid remaining in PPL fractions was removed by a second chloroform-methanol extraction. Final PPL had a protein content below the limits of detection of both the Folin-phenol assay of Lowry et al. (1951) and the amido black assay of Kaplin and Pedersen (1989) modified by the addition of 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to allow accurate quantitation in the presence of lipid.  Human SP-A was a gift from Dr. J. R. Wright at Duke University, and was isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with alveolar proteinosis as described previously (Wright et al. 1987). 
For exposure studies with Mtb, amounts of WLS, CLSE, and PPL used per experiment were 3.3 mg in a total volume of 4 ml. In preliminary studies, this concentration was shown to induce a transcriptional response in Mtb without affecting viability after a 2 h treatment as determined by serial dilutions compared to untreated Mtb.   SP-A was studied at a level of 0.165 mg based on its putative concentration of approximately 5% in endogenous surfactant.  
To determine the effects of lung surfactant on the transcriptional response of Mtb, preparations of WLS, CLSE, or PPL (in 650 µl PBS) were initially coated onto the bottom surface of a 25 cm2 cell culture flask for 30 min at 37oC to mimic a surfactant layer. A minimum of two independent biological replicates were studied for each surfactant preparation. Purified human SP-A was also examined for its effects on Mtb transcription, and phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used as a “no treatment” control. In experiments with SP-A (in 650 µl PBS), the pure apoprotein was either pre-coated on the flask as done with the surfactant preparations, or was directly added and incubated with Mtb during study. Mtb was added to the flask in 3.35 ml of DMEM (supplemented with 2% FCS and 5 mM HEPES) and exposed to coated surfactant/SP-A or PBS control for 30 min or 2h at 37oC, followed by RNA isolation as detailed by Rohde et al. (2008). GTC lysis/stabilization buffer was added, and pelleted Mtb were washed and then digested with lysozyme. TRIzol (Invitrogen) was added, and organisms were disrupted using glass beads in a Mini-Bead Beater (BioSpec Products, Inc. Bartlesville, OK). After extraction of Mtb lysates with chloroform, ethanol was added to the aqueous phase before loading samples onto RNeasy mini columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Subsequent steps were then performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Following elution with RNase-free water, the RNA samples were treated with DNase (Turbo DNAfree, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and stored at -70oC until analysis.    
The MessageAmpTMII-Bacteria system (Applied Biosystems) was used to amplify mycobacterial RNA for all samples [16]. Total RNA was reverse transcribed to yield double-stranded amino-allyl modified aRNA, which was labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen). Excess reactive dyes were removed with a Mega Clear purification kit (Applied Biosystems).  Next, Alexa-labeled aRNA from paired samples was dried using a Speedvac, and re-suspended in hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 25% formamide, 0.15% SDS, and 25 μg salmon sperm DNA). The mixed samples were denatured by being heated to 95oC for and then cooled to 50oC prior to loading them onto microarrays.  The arrays were hybridized for approximately 15 h at 45oC, washed and then dried by centrifugation.  Fluorescence intensity data from each array were collected with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA) using GenePixPro3.0 software (Axon Instruments).  Image analysis, i.e. spot identification, background measurements, quality assessment and flagging were conducted with Imagene software (Version 6.0, BioDiscovery, Inc., El Segundo, CA).  Poor quality spots were filtered and removed from the analysis.  Subsequent normalization, statistical analysis (i.e. t-test), and visualization of array data was conducted using Genespring (Version 7, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).
