      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M  trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

      <Label-Protocol>
DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M  trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M  trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M  trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M  trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

Aminosilane-coated slides were prehybridized in 5x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) (Invitrogen), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42 C degree for 60 min.  The slides then were washed at room temperature with distilled water, dipped in isopropanol, and allowed to dry.  Equal volumes of the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined, dried and then resuspended in a solution of 40% formamide, 5x SSC, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Resuspended probes were heated to 95 C degree  prior to hybridization.  The probe mixture then was added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize overnight at 42 C degree.   Hybridized slides were washed sequentially in solutions of 1x SSC-0.2% SDS, 0.1x SSC-0.2% SDS, and 0.1x SSC at room temperature, then dried in air.
