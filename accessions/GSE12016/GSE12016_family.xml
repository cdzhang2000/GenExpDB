Product description:
The sciTRACER S. aureus contains 2338 PCR products from all 2593 ORFs in the annotated genome (Ref ID: NC_002745), arranged in unique and second sequences: since the ORFs sizes range from 51 bp (e.g.: 13700427) up to 2kb (e.g.: 13701232), additional second PCR products have been developed. As unique sequences, 2333 PCR products and as second sequences, 333 PCR products are immobilized from which 5 are not in the group of unique gene fragments. All unique products cover 90 % of all ORFs. All PCR fragments are purified, concentration normalized, dissolved in spotting solution and spotted robotically onto modified glass slides. They are represented twice (duplicates) on each array. Controls are usually spotted in the last row of each subarray block forming the control area and comprising controls for spiking and endogenous controls.
The SCIENION control set consists of positive, negative and multifunctional elements. All references/controls are spotted in a special pattern enabling functional monitoring of the entire experimental process. The glass slides are processed and ready for hybridization reaction. For easy correlation of gene names to their spot position on the slide the “Spot Identification Pattern-Table” (gal-file) is available.
Information source:
The genes represented on sciTRACER S. aureus are selected from order requests derived from the University of Würzburg, Infectious Biology Group (Head: Prof. Dr. Jörg Hacker) at the Institut für Molekulare Infektionsbiologie.
Generation of sequences:
1. The PCR fragments derive mostly from regions at the last 500 nt from the 3’ end and have an average size of 355 bps. In case that the predicted ORF displayed a size unsuitable for appropriate amplicon generation, the primer design was extended towards flanking regions in order to cover the desired ORF.
2. All selected sequences are designed to provide the highest specificity and display minimal similarity to other mRNA and DNA sequences within the specified host genome.
3. In order to obtain strong and comparable sensitivity and signal specificity, all fragments are designed to feature similar lengths, comparable G/C-contents and optimized melting temperatures.
4. Based on algorithmic and manual revisions of the predicted sequences, the designed PCR fragments are well suited for the generation of highly reliable gene expression data.
Quality controls:
All sequences are validated in silico and approved by size control and sequence verification. The spot morphology is checked by automated optical control and hybridization of labeled RNA or SyBRGreenI® assay. Functional tests are performed by complex hybridization with labeled reference RNA for each batch.
Source Organism:
Staphylococcus aureus N 315 (NC_002745, contig BA000018)
Microarray mapping:
Each SCIENION microarray consists of two regions: the hybridizing region and the identifier region. The identifier region carries a sticker showing the name of the product, the date of production, batch number and the ID of the array. This region also serves to grasp the slide. The DNA microarray is in the center of the hybridizing region. Spot distance and feature size: The spot distance (center to center) is 375 µm. The array size is approximately 54 mm x 18 mm (height x broadness). Each array consists of 48 blocks and each block comprises 12 x 11 spots. These blocks are separated by a blank line and display a defined order.

Exponential-phase cultures of 10 ml for total RNA preparations were grown as aforementioned and fixed by incubation with two volumes of prewarmed RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 5 min at 37°C. The cells were subsequently harvested by 20 min of centrifugation at 4000 rpm and 37°C, and the pellets were shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at -70°C. The cells were lysed in the presence of 400 µg/ml lysostaphin (Genmedics, Reutlingen, Germany) and total RNA was extracted using the PrestoSpin R bug kit including DNase I treatment (Molzym, Bremen, Germany) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Quality and quantity of total RNA were confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and measured using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, USA).

Fluorescence-labeled DNA was obtained by reverse transcription of total RNA. Therefore, total RNA preparations (3 µg) were transcribed into cDNA using BioScript reverse transcriptase (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany) and pd(N)6 random hexamers (GE Healthcare - Amersham, NJ, USA) following the manufacturers’ instructions. For fluorescence-labeling, three different aliquots of cDNA preparations from separate cultures of the respective experiment were pooled to a total amount of 300 ng (100 ng each) and were subsequently employed in the labeling reaction using the BioPrime(R) DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) according to the instruction manual using pd(N)6 random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.1 mM CyDye3- or CyDye5-dCTPs aside from 0.2 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dTTP, 0.5 mM dGTP (GE Healthcare - Amersham).

Microarray transcriptional profiling by competitive hybridization of fluorescence-labeled DNA was performed using the custom PCR product full-genome chip sciTracer (Scienion, Berlin, Germany) containing 2338 unique open reading frames representing 90% of the S. aureus N315 genome (NC_002745). Additional information on the microarray platform is described elsewhere. The experiment was performed 2 times including a dye swap resulting in two chips per competitive comparison with the incorporated dye reversed on two separate arrays. All hybridizations were done with equal amounts of fluorescence-labeled DNA probes or picomols of dye. Fluorescence-labeled DNA probes were mixed in hybridization buffer (Scienion) in a total volume of 55 µl and denatured at 95°C for 2 min and subsequently applied to the microarray slide following incubation at 42°C for 72 hours under humidified conditions according to the manufacturer’s  instructions. Hybridized microarrays were washed at room temperature in SSC buffer with decreasing salt concentrations (1 x SSC/0.3% SDS for 5 min, 0.2 x SSC for 5 min, 0.06 x SSC for 30s).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The intensity of fluorescence of the microarray was scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments/Distribution by Biozyme Scientific GmbH, Hessisch Oldendorf, Germany). TIFF images were captured and analysed with GenePixPro4.1 software (Axon Instruments). The actual signal intensity was calculated by substracting the mean value of the local background intensity from the mean value of the signal intensity of the individual spot.

    <Summary>
The lantibiotic mersacidin is an antimicrobial peptide of 20 amino acids that is produced by Bacillus sp. strain HIL Y-85,54728. Lantibiotics are antibiotics containing nonproteinogenic amino acids like lanthionine and/or 3-methyllanthionine. Mersacidin interferes with cell wall biosynthesis by targeting the peptidoglycan precursor lipid II and inhibits the growth of MRSA and other gram-positive bacteria. Therefore, mersacidin could be a lead substance for the development of new antibacterial agents. The clinical VISA isolates S. aureus 137/93A and its spontaneous mutant S. aureus 137/93G show reduced sensitivity towards mersacidin. This phenotype could not be traced to factors being responsible for vancomycinresistance (i.e. the thickened cell wall).
Here, we focussed on the comparative transcriptome analysis of S. aureus 137/93A and S. aureus SG511 (sensitive strain) via full genome S. aureus microarrays to identify genes involved in the reduced sensitivity towards mersacidin.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
In this experiment, the transcriptomes of S. aureus 137/93A and S. aureus SG511 (sensitive strain) should be compared via microarray analysis. To this end, S. aureus 137/93A and S. aureus SG511 were grown without mersacidin to determine the genes which are differently expressed in these strains. Each experiment was performed 2 times including a dye swap resulting in two chips per competitive comparison with the incorporated dye reversed. All hybridizations were done with equal amounts of fluorescence-labeled cDNA probes or picomols of dye.
