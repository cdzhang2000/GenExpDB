Prior to each experiment bacteria were loop inoculated from a cryo-culture (-80°C) onto a LBT plate and incubated for 3 days at 37°C.  A colony was picked from the plate and inoculated into the 5 ml batch medium in a 30 ml glass universal and incubacted at 37°C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. At an OD between 0.3 - 0.5 a sample was withdrawn to inoculate the bioreactor (700 ml) to a starting OD600 of 0.005. The culture was then left in batch mode under oxystatic condition (maintaining an air saturation of 50% i.e. 10% dissolved oxygen concentration) until OD600 reached around 80% of maximum OD600 and then turned in to chemostat mode either at a dilution rate of 4.6 h-1 or 69 h-1. The chemostat was then left running for at least two volume changes before harvest.

Prior to each experiment bacteria were loop inoculated from a cryo-culture (-80°C) onto a LBT plate and incubated for 3 days at 37°C.  A colony was picked from the plate and inoculated into the 5 ml batch medium in a 30 ml glass universal and incubacted at 37°C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. At an OD between 0.3 - 0.5 a sample was withdrawn to inoculate the bioreactor (700 ml) to a starting OD600 of 0.005. The culture was then left in batch mode under oxystatic condition (maintaining an air saturation of 50% i.e. 10% dissolved oxygen concentration) until OD600 reached around 80% of maximum OD600 and then turned in to chemostat mode either at a dilution rate of 4.6 h-1 or 69 h-1. The chemostat was then left running for at least two volume changes before harvest.

Prior to each experiment bacteria were loop inoculated from a cryo-culture (-80°C) onto a LBT plate and incubated for 3 days at 37°C.  A colony was picked from the plate and inoculated into the 5 ml batch medium in a 30 ml glass universal and incubacted at 37°C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. At an OD between 0.3 - 0.5 a sample was withdrawn to inoculate the bioreactor (700 ml) to a starting OD600 of 0.005. The culture was then left in batch mode under oxystatic condition (maintaining an air saturation of 50% i.e. 10% dissolved oxygen concentration) until OD600 reached around 80% of maximum OD600 and then turned in to chemostat mode either at a dilution rate of 4.6 h-1 or 69 h-1. The chemostat was then left running for at least two volume changes before harvest.

Prior to each experiment bacteria were loop inoculated from a cryo-culture (-80°C) onto a LBT plate and incubated for 3 days at 37°C.  A colony was picked from the plate and inoculated into the 5 ml batch medium in a 30 ml glass universal and incubacted at 37°C on a rotary shaker at 200 rpm. At an OD between 0.3 - 0.5 a sample was withdrawn to inoculate the bioreactor (700 ml) to a starting OD600 of 0.005. The culture was then left in batch mode under oxystatic condition (maintaining an air saturation of 50% i.e. 10% dissolved oxygen concentration) until OD600 reached around 80% of maximum OD600 and then turned in to chemostat mode either at a dilution rate of 4.6 h-1 or 69 h-1. The chemostat was then left running for at least two volume changes before harvest.
