Cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (GIBCO BRL) and transferred to 2-ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml 0.1-mm diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Clinical isolate 1254, 7H9 medium (supplemented with BSA, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol), 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks, 90 rpm shaking, and a starting culture density of OD 0.15 were used, unless otherwise indicated. RNA samples isolated from OD 0.15 cultures of the M. tuberculosis strain being assayed on the same day were used for the reference sample in each experiment. Cells were collected with a 4-min centrifugation step and frozen on dry ice.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Cell debris was separated by a 45-s centrifugation. The supernatant was transferred to 2-ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul chloroform, inverted rapidly for 15 s, and incubated 2 min. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul isopropanol, followed by addition of 270 ul of the following mixture: 0.8 M sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 4 C and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml 75% ethanol, centrifuged 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul water, 10 ul DNase I 10x buffer, and 6 U DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (QIAGEN).

      <Label-Protocol>
Both a PCR gene product microarray and a 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set; QIAGEN) were used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 2 ug total RNA and 4.4ug of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated for 2 min at 98 C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02 mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences), and 1.8 ul Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) in a total volume of 25 ul, and incubated for 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
10 ul of hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 ug tRNA, 3.8x SSC, 0.27% SDS) was sealed under a coverslip with rubber cement and hybridized overnight at 65 C for the DNA microarray. Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5x SSC, 1% BSA, and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. After the prehybridization, 10 ul of hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 ug tRNA, 2x SSC, 25% formamide, and 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A (Axon Instruments, Inc.). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (M. Eisen, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, CA).

Cell debris was separated by a 45-s centrifugation. The supernatant was transferred to 2-ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul chloroform, inverted rapidly for 15 s, and incubated 2 min. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul isopropanol, followed by addition of 270 ul of the following mixture: 0.8 M sodium citrate and 1.2 M NaCl. Samples were incubated for 10 min at 4 C and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml 75% ethanol, centrifuged 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul water, 10 ul DNase I 10x buffer, and 6 U DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (QIAGEN).

    <Title>Inhibition of Respiration by Nitric Oxide Induces a Mycobacterium tuberculosis Dormancy Program</Title>

    <Summary>
An estimated two billion persons are latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The host factors that initiate and maintain this latent state and the mechanisms by which M. tuberculosis survives within latent lesions are compelling but unanswered questions. One such host factor may be nitric oxide (NO), a product of activated macrophages that exhibits antimycobacterial properties. Evidence for the possible significance of NO comes from murine models of tuberculosis showing progressive infection in animals unable to produce the inducible isoform of NO synthase and in animals treated with a NO synthase inhibitor. Here, we show that O2 and low, nontoxic concentrations of NO competitively modulate the expression of a 48-gene regulon, which is expressed in vivo and prepares bacilli for survival during long periods of in vitro dormancy. NO was found to reversibly inhibit aerobic respiration and growth. A heme-containing enzyme, possibly the terminal oxidase in the respiratory pathway, likely senses and integrates NO and O2 levels and signals the regulon. These data lead to a model postulating that, within granulomas, inhibition of respiration by NO production and O2 limitation constrains M. tuberculosis replication rates in persons with latent tuberculosis.
