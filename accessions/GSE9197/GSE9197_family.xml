    <Manufacture-Protocol>
Microarray consists of full-length PCR products from all 4,290 annotated open reading frames (ORFs) in E. coli mg1655 (1).  PCR products are printed in replicate on standard, 1” X 3”, poly-l-lysine coated glass microscope slides.  Greater than 95% have been shown to migrate as a single band, of the predicted molecular weight, as determined by gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining.  Also printed on each microarray are &gt;200 control spots consisting of: fragmented E. coli genomic DNA, non-specific salmon sperm DNA, 3X SSC, and &gt;25 different yeast ORF PCR products (see master table). These microarrays are printed using a 16-pin configuration, resulting in a pattern of 32 sub-arrays each having geometry of 17 rows by 18 columns with spot diameter averaging 100 microns. To aid in locating the array, the top and bottom array boundaries are etched on the back of the microscope slide.  A unique serial number is also etched on the array side at the bottom of the slide (see diagram in master table). The integrity and quality of each set of microarrays have been verified by hybridization with fluorescent-labeled cDNA and genomic DNA.

Bacterial cultures were inoculated and grown as described previously (1,2).  An inoculum from a 37˚C grown single colony was used to initiate parallel, colony matched 37˚C and 23˚C grown cultures.  The cells from these cultures were harvested at equivalent optical densities after approximately 9-11 generations growth in early-mid exponential phase (OD600= 0.2-0.6).  Cell pellets were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC for RNA isolation.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization was completed as described previously (1). The hybridization solution (10 μl of cDNA mixture, 1 μl of denatured rat Hybloc DNA (1 μg/μl), 20 μl of 2X SDS buffer, 2 μl of dT blocker, and 7 μl of nuclease-free water) was placed over a prewarmed microarray slide and covered with a Corning 22x40 mm coverslip.  The slide was then sealed in a hybridization chamber and submerged for 3 days in a 60˚C water bath.  Microarray slides were washed for 10 minutes in 2X SSC, 0.2% SDS at 37ºC, 10 minutes in 2X SSC at room temperature, and 10 minutes in 0.2X SSC at room temperature.  Slides were dried by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for two minutes.  For the second hybridization to allow the 3DNA capture reagent to bind to the complementary Cy3 or Cy5 specific 3DNA capture sequences ligated to the cDNAs, each microarray received 42 μl of hybridization solution (2.5 μl of Cy3 capture reagent, 2.5 μl of Cy5 capture reagent, 21 μl of 2X SDS buffer, 0.5 μl anti-fade reagent, and 15.5 μl of nuclease-free water) and hybridized as before via submersion for 3-4 hours in a 61ºC water bath.  The slides were washed, dried , and kept in the dark until they were scanned and analyzed.

Five slides were used in the analysis with cDNAs, representing three independent growth experiments and two technical replicates (1).  Hybridized slides were scanned using GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.).  Photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage was altered for the initial scanning to ensure proper channel balance and decrease background.  Any gene feature that had a signal-to-background ratio &lt; 2.0 was rejected and not further analyzed.  The ratio of medians values were used for further analysis.

Bacterial cultures were inoculated and grown as described previously (1,2).  An inoculum from a 37˚C grown single colony was used to initiate parallel, colony matched 37˚C and 23˚C grown cultures.  The cells from these cultures were harvested at equivalent optical densities after approximately 9-11 generations growth in early-mid exponential phase (OD600= 0.2-0.6).  Cell pellets were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80ºC for RNA isolation.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization was completed as described previously (1). The hybridization solution (10 μl of cDNA mixture, 1 μl of denatured rat Hybloc DNA (1 μg/μl), 20 μl of 2X SDS buffer, 2 μl of dT blocker, and 7 μl of nuclease-free water) was placed over a prewarmed microarray slide and covered with a Corning 22x40 mm coverslip.  The slide was then sealed in a hybridization chamber and submerged for 3 days in a 60˚C water bath.  Microarray slides were washed for 10 minutes in 2X SSC, 0.2% SDS at 37ºC, 10 minutes in 2X SSC at room temperature, and 10 minutes in 0.2X SSC at room temperature.  Slides were dried by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for two minutes.  For the second hybridization to allow the 3DNA capture reagent to bind to the complementary Cy3 or Cy5 specific 3DNA capture sequences ligated to the cDNAs, each microarray received 42 μl of hybridization solution (2.5 μl of Cy3 capture reagent, 2.5 μl of Cy5 capture reagent, 21 μl of 2X SDS buffer, 0.5 μl anti-fade reagent, and 15.5 μl of nuclease-free water) and hybridized as before via submersion for 3-4 hours in a 61ºC water bath.  The slides were washed, dried , and kept in the dark until they were scanned and analyzed.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Five slides were used in the analysis with cDNAs, representing three independent growth experiments and two technical replicates (1).  Hybridized slides were scanned using GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.).  Photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage was altered for the initial scanning to ensure proper channel balance and decrease background.  Any gene feature that had a signal-to-background ratio &lt; 2.0 was rejected and not further analyzed.  The ratio of medians values were used for further analysis.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization was completed as described previously (1). The hybridization solution (10 μl of cDNA mixture, 1 μl of denatured rat Hybloc DNA (1 μg/μl), 20 μl of 2X SDS buffer, 2 μl of dT blocker, and 7 μl of nuclease-free water) was placed over a prewarmed microarray slide and covered with a Corning 22x40 mm coverslip.  The slide was then sealed in a hybridization chamber and submerged for 3 days in a 60˚C water bath.  Microarray slides were washed for 10 minutes in 2X SSC, 0.2% SDS at 37ºC, 10 minutes in 2X SSC at room temperature, and 10 minutes in 0.2X SSC at room temperature.  Slides were dried by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for two minutes.  For the second hybridization to allow the 3DNA capture reagent to bind to the complementary Cy3 or Cy5 specific 3DNA capture sequences ligated to the cDNAs, each microarray received 42 μl of hybridization solution (2.5 μl of Cy3 capture reagent, 2.5 μl of Cy5 capture reagent, 21 μl of 2X SDS buffer, 0.5 μl anti-fade reagent, and 15.5 μl of nuclease-free water) and hybridized as before via submersion for 3-4 hours in a 61ºC water bath.  The slides were washed, dried , and kept in the dark until they were scanned and analyzed.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Five slides were used in the analysis with cDNAs, representing three independent growth experiments and two technical replicates (1).  Hybridized slides were scanned using GenePix Pro 4.1 software (Axon Instruments, Inc.).  Photomultiplier tube (PMT) voltage was altered for the initial scanning to ensure proper channel balance and decrease background.  Any gene feature that had a signal-to-background ratio &lt; 2.0 was rejected and not further analyzed.  The ratio of medians values were used for further analysis.

    <Summary>
Because many virulence genes in E. coli and other pathogens are regulated by temperature, we wanted to determine on a genome-wide scale which genes are modulated in adapting to both human host temperature (37˚C) and ambient room temperature (23˚C).  Overall, 126 genes were found to be more highly expressed at 37˚C (1) whereas 297 genes were more highly expressed at 23˚C (2).  Genes involved in the uptake and utilization of amino acids, carbohydrates, and iron dominated the 37˚C list, supporting a model in which temperature serves as a host cue to increase expression of bacterial genes needed for growth. 122 of the 297 genes more highly expressed at 23˚C are RpoS-controlled, confirming genome-wide the model that low temperature serves as a primary cue to trigger the general stress response.  Several genes expressed at 23˚C overlap with the cold shock response, suggesting that strategies used to adapt to sudden shifts in temperature also mediate long-term growth at 23˚C.  Another category of genes more highly expressed at 23˚C are associated with biofilm development, implicating temperature as an important cue influencing this developmental pathway.

    <Overall-Design>
Growth and medium conditions were chosen (M9 glycerol medium with aeration) that maximize papBA transcription at 37˚C so we could use this operon as a temperature-regulated positive control in our microarrays.  Parallel cultures grown at 37˚C and 23˚C were harvested in exponential phase (OD600=0.2-0.6) at 9-11 generations growth after inoculation.  Thus, the results presented here reflect the adapted state and signify genes whose expression is differentially maintained over long-term growth at a given temperature.
