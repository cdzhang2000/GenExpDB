    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridisations were carried out in a 50μl volume per array. The volume of CyDye label cDNA was reduced in a SpeedVac and be adjusted to 21.5μL then denatured at 94°C for 2 min, centrifuge 2 min and let it cool at RT for 1 min. the labelled cDNA with 37.5μL of hybridisation buffer (Morpholine-4-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) hydrate (pH 6.5) (Sigma, M2933) 50 mM, Sodium chloride 1 M, 99% Formamide (Sigma, F5786) 20 % (w/v), EDTA 20 mM, Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8532) 1 % (w/v)). 50μl of hybridisation mix was pipetted onto the GASKET slide and an OGT array slide was placed in contact with the hybridisation mix. In a tight chamber, the arrays were hybridise at 55°C for 60 hours in a light tight hybridisation oven at 4 to 8 rpm. The slide was removed from the hybridisation chamber and washed with buffer 1 (6XSSPE, 0.005% N-lauryl sarcosine) for 5min under agitation and for 5 min with the wash buffer 2 (0.06X SSPE, 0.18% polyethylene glycol 200) then dried in a centrifuge.

The volume of CyDye label cDNA was reduced in a SpeedVac and be adjusted to 21.5μL then denatured at 94°C for 2 min, centrifuge 2 min and let it cool at RT for 1 min. the labelled cDNA with 37.5μL of hybridisation buffer (Morpholine-4-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) hydrate (pH 6.5) (Sigma, M2933) 50 mM, Sodium chloride 1 M, 99% Formamide (Sigma, F5786) 20 % (w/v), EDTA 20 mM, Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8532) 1 % (w/v)). 50μl of hybridisation mix was pipetted onto the GASKET slide and an OGT array slide was placed in contact with the hybridisation mix. In a tight chamber, the arrays were hybridise at 55°C for 60 hours in a light tight hybridisation oven at 4 to 8 rpm. The slide was removed from the hybridisation chamber and washed with buffer 1 (6XSSPE, 0.005% N-lauryl sarcosine) for 5min under agitation and for 5 min with the wash buffer 2 (0.06X SSPE, 0.18% polyethylene glycol 200) then dried in a centrifuge.

Hybridisations were carried out in a 50μl volume per array. The volume of CyDye label cDNA was reduced in a SpeedVac and be adjusted to 21.5μL then denatured at 94°C for 2 min, centrifuge 2 min and let it cool at RT for 1 min. the labelled cDNA with 37.5μL of hybridisation buffer (Morpholine-4-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) hydrate (pH 6.5) (Sigma, M2933) 50 mM, Sodium chloride 1 M, 99% Formamide (Sigma, F5786) 20 % (w/v), EDTA 20 mM, Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8532) 1 % (w/v)). 50μl of hybridisation mix was pipetted onto the GASKET slide and an OGT array slide was placed in contact with the hybridisation mix. In a tight chamber, the arrays were hybridise at 55°C for 60 hours in a light tight hybridisation oven at 4 to 8 rpm. The slide was removed from the hybridisation chamber and washed with buffer 1 (6XSSPE, 0.005% N-lauryl sarcosine) for 5min under agitation and for 5 min with the wash buffer 2 (0.06X SSPE, 0.18% polyethylene glycol 200) then dried in a centrifuge.

Total RNA  (10 μg) was converted to cDNA and fluorescently labelled by random priming to incorporate Cy5-dCTP (Amersham) using reverse transcriptase (StrataScript, Stratagene).
2 µg of chromosomal was labelled with Cy3 dCTP using the Gibco Bioprime DNA labelling System.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridisations were carried out in a 50μl volume per array. The volume of CyDye label cDNA was reduced in a SpeedVac and be adjusted to 21.5μL then denatured at 94°C for 2 min, centrifuge 2 min and let it cool at RT for 1 min. the labelled cDNA with 37.5μL of hybridisation buffer (Morpholine-4-ethanesulfonic acid (MES) hydrate (pH 6.5) (Sigma, M2933) 50 mM, Sodium chloride 1 M, 99% Formamide (Sigma, F5786) 20 % (w/v), EDTA 20 mM, Triton X-100 (Sigma, T8532) 1 % (w/v)). 50μl of hybridisation mix was pipetted onto the GASKET slide and an OGT array slide was placed in contact with the hybridisation mix. In a tight chamber, the arrays were hybridise at 55°C for 60 hours in a light tight hybridisation oven at 4 to 8 rpm. The slide was removed from the hybridisation chamber and washed with buffer 1 (6XSSPE, 0.005% N-lauryl sarcosine) for 5min under agitation and for 5 min with the wash buffer 2 (0.06X SSPE, 0.18% polyethylene glycol 200) then dried in a centrifuge.

    <Summary>
Transcriptional profiling of Salmonella Typhimurium SL1344 wild type and deleted of the response regulator encoding gene baeR grown to OD600=1 in LB alone or in LB supplemented with 20mM of Sodium Tungstate. The goal is to determine Salmonella response to tungstate and to define the BaeR regulated genes in this conditions.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
4 differents conditions tested, the reference on each hybridisation is the chromosomique DNA of the wild type strain. 3 replicates for the wild type on LB, 3 replicates for the baeR on LB, 3 replicates for the wild type on LB+ tungstate and 5 replicates for baeR on LB+tungstate.
