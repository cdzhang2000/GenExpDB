    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

The cells were cultured at 30 ℃ in LB with ampicillin until the optical density at 660nm (OD) reached to 0.3. The antibiotics were then removed and the temperature was shifted up to 42 ℃ to block the plasmid replication. The culture was diluted 100-folds when its OD660 reached 0.5 (2h after the temperature shift). The cells were harvested and subjected to transcriptome analysis before (0h) and 1 h, 1 h 50 min, and 3 h after the temperature shift (OD=0.5).

The cells were cultured at 30 ℃ in LB with ampicillin until the optical density at 660nm (OD) reached to 0.3. The antibiotics were then removed and the temperature was shifted up to 42 ℃ to block the plasmid replication. The culture was diluted 100-folds when its OD660 reached 0.5 (2h after the temperature shift). The cells were harvested and subjected to transcriptome analysis before (0h) and 1 h, 1 h 50 min, and 3 h after the temperature shift (OD=0.5).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
The cells were harvested by centrifugation, and stabilized using RNA Protect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen) in accordance with the manufacturer’s protocols (see http://www1.qiagen.com).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were cultured at 30 ℃ in LB with ampicillin until the optical density at 660nm (OD) reached to 0.3. The antibiotics were then removed and the temperature was shifted up to 42 ℃ to block the plasmid replication. The culture was diluted 100-folds when its OD660 reached 0.5 (2h after the temperature shift). The cells were harvested and subjected to transcriptome analysis before (0h) and 1 h, 1 h 50 min, and 3 h after the temperature shift (OD=0.5).

      <Growth-Protocol>
The cells were cultured at 30 ℃ in LB with ampicillin until the optical density at 660nm (OD) reached to 0.3. The antibiotics were then removed and the temperature was shifted up to 42 ℃ to block the plasmid replication. The culture was diluted 100-folds when its OD660 reached 0.5 (2h after the temperature shift). The cells were harvested and subjected to transcriptome analysis before (0h) and 1 h, 1 h 50 min, and 3 h after the temperature shift (OD=0.5).

    <Title>Expression profiles during cell death programmed by a restriction-modification system in E. coli</Title>

    <Summary>
Genetically programmed deaths play important roles in the biology of unicellular prokaryotic cells. Some gene complexes force their maintenance on the host bacterial cells by killing cells that have lost them. This form of programmed death called post-segregational killing or genetic addiction is brought about by several Type II restriction-modification gene complexes, through restriction attack on the undermethylated chromosome, and underlie their behavior as selfish mobile elements. To learn the genetic steps to death, we examined how carriage and loss of PaeR7I restriction-modification gene complex affect host Escherichia coli cells through transcriptome and experimental analyses. The PaeR7I complex was on a temperature-sensitive plasmid so that the killing was induced by a temperature shift.
We used microarrays to detail the global program of gene expression underlying cell death process mediated by PaeR7I restriction-modification system in E. coli.
Keywords: time course
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Post-segregational cell killing was induced by blocking replication of a temperature sensitive plasmid carrying PaeR7I RM gene complex by shifting up the cultivation temperature. At 30℃, the permissive temperature for the plasmid replication, growth as monitored by OD660, of MG1655/pTN9 (r+m+) was indistinguishable from those of MG1655/pTN11 (r-m+) and MG1655/pHSG415 (vector). Cell death was observed at least 4 h after the temperature shift only in MG1655/pTN9 (r+m+) as in the previous works; the increase in viable cell counts stopped and resulted in decrease of cell viability. To analyze global gene expression when cells went to death, we performed transcriptome analysis 0 h, 1h, 1 h 50 min, and 3h after the temperature shift.  We used Affimetrix E. coli antisense genome array. Experiments were performed independently twice.
