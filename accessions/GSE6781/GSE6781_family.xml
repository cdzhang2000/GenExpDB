The 70-mer oligonucleotide array was constructed, containing 6112 oligonucleotides that sampled chromosomal genes identified in the genome sequences of E. coli strains K-12 MG1655, O157:H7 VT2 Sakai, and O157:H7 EDL933 and plasmid genes from the two genome-sequenced O157:H7 strains (the Operon Array Ready E. coli Oligonucleotide™ set 1.0, Qiagen- Operon, Hilden, Germany). 12 positive and 12 negative control oligonucleotides were also included. The oligonucleotides were resuspended in Corning Pronto! buffer and printed on to Corning UltraGAPS™ slides (Corning B.V Life Sciences, Schiphol-Rijk, Netherlands ) using a Biorobotics Microgrid TAS array printer. Amersham Lucidea  Universal Scorecard™ controls (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) were printed in each subarray. Slides were desiccated under vacuum for 48 hours and then U.V. cross-linked with a dose of 600mJ using a Stratalinker (Stratagene limited, U.K.). Slides were stored under desiccating conditions in the dark until use

Slides were immediately transferred into prewarmed prehybridization solution (5xSSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 2–4 h at 42 °C. The microarray slides were finally washed at room temperature once in 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min and twice in 0.1xSSC for 30 s, briefly dipped in water and then ethanol, and dried by centrifugation for 5 min at 800xg. For each experiment, equal quantities (80 pmol) of each Cy5- and Cy3-labeled cDNA were added to a final volume of 80 microlitre of hybridization solution containing 25% formamide, 10 mg of bovine serum albumin (fraction V) per ml, 5xSSC (1xSSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 8 micrograms of poly(A), and 1xDenhardt’s solution.

    <Description>
Successful pathogens must be able to protect themselves against reactive nitrogen species generated either as part of host defence mechanisms, or as products of their own metabolism. The regulatory protein, NsrR (a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors), plays key roles in this stress response. Microarray analysis was utilised to reveal the full role of NsrR.
Regulation by NsrR is known to be extremely sensitive to repressor titration by NsrR-binding sites provided on a multicopy plasmid. Transformation of an nsrR+ strain with plasmid pGIT1, which carries the ytfE promoter in multicopy, titrates out NsrR to phenocopy an NsrR- mutation. As a control, pGIT8 carries the same promoter fragment, but a 1 bp deletion mutation in the NsrR binding site eliminates repressor titration in vivo. Strain MG1655 transformed with either pGIT1 was grown anaerobically and RNA was isolated from early exponential phase cultures grown in the presence of nitrite.  A pool of RNA from the control strain (MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 and grown in the absence of nitrite) was included as a common reference.

Regulation by NsrR is known to be extremely sensitive to repressor titration by NsrR-binding sites provided on a multicopy plasmid. Transformation of an nsrR+ strain with plasmid pGIT1, which carries the ytfE promoter in multicopy, titrates out NsrR to phenocopy an NsrR- mutation. As a control, pGIT8 carries the same promoter fragment, but a 1 bp deletion mutation in the NsrR binding site eliminates repressor titration in vivo. Strain MG1655 transformed with either pGIT1 was grown anaerobically and RNA was isolated from early exponential phase cultures grown in the presence of nitrite.  A pool of RNA from the control strain (MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 and grown in the absence of nitrite) was included as a common reference.

    <Description>
Successful pathogens must be able to protect themselves against reactive nitrogen species generated either as part of host defence mechanisms, or as products of their own metabolism. The regulatory protein, NsrR (a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors), plays key roles in this stress response. Microarray analysis was utilised to reveal the full role of NsrR.
Regulation by NsrR is known to be extremely sensitive to repressor titration by NsrR-binding sites provided on a multicopy plasmid. Transformation of an nsrR+ strain with plasmid pGIT1, which carries the ytfE promoter in multicopy, titrates out NsrR to phenocopy an NsrR- mutation. As a control, pGIT8 carries the same promoter fragment, but a 1 bp deletion mutation in the NsrR binding site eliminates repressor titration in vivo. Strain MG1655 transformed with either pGIT1 was grown anaerobically and RNA was isolated from early exponential phase cultures grown in the absence of nitrite.  A pool of RNA from the control strain (MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 and grown in the absence of nitrite) was included as a common reference.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prior to hybridization, the slides were treated with the background-reducing Pronto! Pre-Soak System (Corning Life Sciences). The slides were incubated for 20 min in prewarmed Universal Pre-Soak solution at 42 °C and washed twice in 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 s at room temperature. Slides were immediately transferred into prewarmed prehybridization solution (5xSSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 2–4 h at 42 °C. The microarray slides were finally washed at room temperature once in 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min and twice in 0.1xSSC for 30 s, briefly dipped in water and then ethanol, and dried by centrifugation for 5 min at 800xg. For each experiment, equal quantities (80 pmol) of each Cy5- and Cy3-labeled cDNA were added to a final volume of 80 microlitre of hybridization solution containing 25% formamide, 10 mg of bovine serum albumin (fraction V) per ml, 5xSSC (1xSSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 8 micrograms of poly(A), and 1xDenhardt’s solution. The cDNA probes were denatured at 95 °C for 3 min and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C in an Advalytix Hyb station. After hybridization was complete, the slides were washed in an Advalytix Wash station with 2xSSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, followed with 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and finally twice in 0.1xSSC at room temperature. The microarray slides were dried by centrifugation for 5min at 800g.

    <Description>
Successful pathogens must be able to protect themselves against reactive nitrogen species generated either as part of host defence mechanisms, or as products of their own metabolism. The regulatory protein, NsrR (a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors), plays key roles in this stress response. Microarray analysis was utilised to reveal the full role of NsrR. Regulation by NsrR is known to be extremely sensitive to repressor titration by NsrR-binding sites provided on a multicopy plasmid. Transformation of an nsrR+ strain with plasmid pGIT1, which carries the ytfE promoter in multicopy, titrates out NsrR to phenocopy an NsrR- mutation. As a control, pGIT8 carries the same promoter fragment, but a 1 bp deletion mutation in the NsrR binding site eliminates repressor titration in vivo. Strain MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 was grown anaerobically and RNA was isolated from early exponential phase cultures grown in the presence of nitrite. A pool of RNA from the control strain (MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 and grown in the absence of nitrite) was included as a common reference.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prior to hybridization, the slides were treated with the background-reducing Pronto! Pre-Soak System (Corning Life Sciences). The slides were incubated for 20 min in prewarmed Universal Pre-Soak solution at 42 °C and washed twice in 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 s at room temperature. Slides were immediately transferred into prewarmed prehybridization solution (5xSSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin) and incubated for 2–4 h at 42 °C. The microarray slides were finally washed at room temperature once in 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min and twice in 0.1xSSC for 30 s, briefly dipped in water and then ethanol, and dried by centrifugation for 5 min at 800xg. For each experiment, equal quantities (80 pmol) of each Cy5- and Cy3-labeled cDNA were added to a final volume of 80 microlitre of hybridization solution containing 25% formamide, 10 mg of bovine serum albumin (fraction V) per ml, 5xSSC (1xSSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 8 micrograms of poly(A), and 1xDenhardt’s solution. The cDNA probes were denatured at 95 °C for 3 min and hybridized for 16 h at 42 °C in an Advalytix Hyb station. After hybridization was complete, the slides were washed in an Advalytix Wash station with 2xSSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C, followed with 0.1xSSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature, and finally twice in 0.1xSSC at room temperature. The microarray slides were dried by centrifugation for 5min at 800g.

    <Description>
Successful pathogens must be able to protect themselves against reactive nitrogen species generated either as part of host defence mechanisms, or as products of their own metabolism. The regulatory protein, NsrR (a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors), plays key roles in this stress response. Microarray analysis was utilised to reveal the full role of NsrR. Regulation by NsrR is known to be extremely sensitive to repressor titration by NsrR-binding sites provided on a multicopy plasmid. Transformation of an nsrR+ strain with plasmid pGIT1, which carries the ytfE promoter in multicopy, titrates out NsrR to phenocopy an NsrR- mutation. As a control, pGIT8 carries the same promoter fragment, but a 1 bp deletion mutation in the NsrR binding site eliminates repressor titration in vivo. Strain MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 was grown anaerobically and RNA was isolated from early exponential phase cultures grown in the presence of nitrite. A pool of RNA from the control strain (MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 and grown in the absence of nitrite) was included as a common reference.

    <Summary>
Successful pathogens must be able to protect themselves against reactive nitrogen species generated either as part of host defence mechanisms, or as products of their own metabolism. The regulatory protein, NsrR (a member of the Rrf2 family of transcription factors), plays key roles in this stress response. Microarray analysis was carried out to reveal the regulon of NsrR.
Keywords: Response to repressor titration and different growth conditions
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The nsrR gene of E. coli MG1655 is located immediately upstream of, and is co-transcribed with, the rnr gene encoding RNase R. Expression of this transcription unit is cold-shock inducible, which may well involve secondary structures in the mRNA in the vicinity of the nsrR coding region. Deletion of the nsrR gene might therefore perturb rnr expression by a simple consequence of polarity, or by disruption of mRNA structural elements involved in post-transcriptional regulation. The consequence would likely be secondary effects on global RNA stability, hence comparison of the transcriptomes of an nsrR mutant and its parent would be difficult to interpret. To avoid such potential artifacts, we exploited the observation that regulation by NsrR is extremely sensitive to repressor titration by NsrR-binding sites provided on a multicopy plasmid. Transformation of an nsrR+ strain with plasmid pGIT1, which carries the ytfE promoter in multicopy, titrates out NsrR to phenocopy an NsrR- mutation. As a control, pGIT8 carries the same promoter fragment, but a 1 bp deletion mutation in the NsrR binding site eliminates repressor titration in vivo. Strain MG1655 transformed with either pGIT1 or pGIT8 was grown anaerobically under the carefully controlled conditions described previously, so that growth rates were almost identical, and RNA was isolated from early exponential phase cultures grown in the presence or absence of nitrite. For each growth condition, four independent biological replicates were completed, and to validate comparisons between different plasmids and growth conditions, a pool of RNA from the control strain (MG1655 transformed with pGIT8 and grown in the absence of nitrite) was included in every microarray to provide a common reference.
