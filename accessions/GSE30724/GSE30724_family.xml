Samples were added to RNA Protect (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and processed according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Cells were harvested by centrifugation (8,000 X g, 20 min, 4C) and then resuspended in 1 ml Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and processed in an FP120 FastPrep cell disruptor (MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA).  Chloroform was subsequently added to the lysates, followed by centrifugation (16,000 X g, 15 min, 4C) and RNA was precipitated 1:1 (vol/vol) in 100% ethyl alcohol.  The RNA was then purified using the RNeasy™ kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed from purified RNA using DNAfree (Ambion, Austin, TX).  cDNA was produced using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) from 2 µg of total RNA combined with random hexamers, 0.25 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 0.25 mM aminoallyl-dUTP.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were blocked in 1% SDS, 5 X SSC and 1 mg/ml BSA at 42C for 1 h.  Arrays were then washed 2X for 5 min in 0.1X SSC and 2X for 30 sec in sterile double-distilled water.  Arrays were hybirdized to Cy-labeled cDNAs denatured at 05C in 10 mM EDTA for 5 min and mixed with 40 ul hybridization buffer (Ambion) before loading under a caverslip on the array and sealing in hybridization cassettes.  Hybridization was carried out at 47C for 18 h.  Afterwards, array slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.5% SDS at 37C for 5 min, followed by stringency washes 2X in 0.1X SSC at 37C for 2.5 min each, and 2X in 0.1X SSC at room temperature for 2.5 min each.										
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b, and images analyzed using Spotfinder.								
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Array intensity data was log2-transformed, and normalized using the Lowess algorithm.  Statistical analysis was performed using a significance analysis of microarrays (SAM, MultiExperiment Viewer, ver. 4.0) unpaired contrast.  A d-statistic was calculated for each gene based on repeated permutations, and a false discovery rate FDR of 0.01 was used to assign a critical cutoff for significance.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were blocked in 1% SDS, 5 X SSC and 1 mg/ml BSA at 42C for 1 h.  Arrays were then washed 2X for 5 min in 0.1X SSC and 2X for 30 sec in sterile double-distilled water.  Arrays were hybirdized to Cy-labeled cDNAs denatured at 05C in 10 mM EDTA for 5 min and mixed with 40 ul hybridization buffer (Ambion) before loading under a caverslip on the array and sealing in hybridization cassettes.  Hybridization was carried out at 47C for 18 h.  Afterwards, array slides were washed in 2X SSC, 0.5% SDS at 37C for 5 min, followed by stringency washes 2X in 0.1X SSC at 37C for 2.5 min each, and 2X in 0.1X SSC at room temperature for 2.5 min each.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b, and images analyzed using Spotfinder.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Array intensity data was log2-transformed, and normalized using the Lowess algorithm. Duplicates were averaged and ratio was calculated as Treatment/Control. Statistical analysis was performed using a significance analysis of microarrays (SAM, MultiExperiment Viewer, ver. 4.0) unpaired contrast.  A d-statistic was calculated for each gene based on repeated permutations, and a false discovery rate FDR of 0.01 was used to assign a critical cutoff for significance.

Chloroform was subsequently added to the lysates, followed by centrifugation (16,000 X g, 15 min, 4C) and RNA was precipitated 1:1 (vol/vol) in 100% ethyl alcohol.  The RNA was then purified using the RNeasy™ kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating DNA was removed from purified RNA using DNAfree (Ambion, Austin, TX).  cDNA was produced using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) from 2 µg of total RNA combined with random hexamers, 0.25 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate, and 0.25 mM aminoallyl-dUTP.

    <Title>Alterations in the transcriptome and antibiotic susceptibility of Staphylococcus aureus grown in the presence of diclofenac</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE30724</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>21774834</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Diclofenac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which has been shown to increase the susceptibility of various bacteria to antimicrobials and demonstrated to have broad antimicrobial activity.  This study describes transcriptome alterations in S. aureus strain COL grown with diclofenac and characterizes the effects of this NSAID on antibiotic susceptibility in laboratory, clinical and diclofenac reduced-susceptibility (DcRS) mutant S. aureus strains.										
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Four hybridizations, including a biological replicate and a dye-swap experiment for each replicate was carried out. LOWESS normalization was performed on the raw data to correct for dye-bias. Statistical analysis was performed using a significance analysis of microarrays (SAM, MultiExperiment Viewer, ver. 4.0) unpaired contrast.  A d-statistic was calculated for each gene based on repeated permutations, and a false discovery rate FDR of 0.01 was used to assign a critical cutoff for significance.
