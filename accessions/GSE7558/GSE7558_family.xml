Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the mutant was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the wild type was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the wild type was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the wild type was labeled with Cy-3 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the wild type was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the mutant was labeled with Cy-3 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the mutant was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the mutant was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the mutant was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA was isolated from the cultures using an RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAprotect bacteria reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was added to the cultures to stabilize RNA before isolation. The RNase-free DNase set (QIAGEN, Inc., Valencia, CA) was used for on-column DNase digestion to remove residual genomic DNA. The quantity and quality of RNA was examined using ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop® Technologies, Wilmington, DE) and bioanalyser 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) respectively.

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the wild type was labeled with Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

Total RNA (10 µg) was used to synthesize cDNA using a random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated overnight with Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and the cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs from the mutant was labeled with Cy-3 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The labeling mixtures were further purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Equal amounts of labeled cDNA from the treatment and control were used to hybridize S. Typhimurium LT2 genome microarrays (version 4), obtained from The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR, Rockville, MD). These arrays were 70 mer-oligo arrays with 4504 ORF each, with 5 replicate spots per ORF. The labeled cDNA was applied to the above arrays. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 42°C in a water bath using Corning hybridization chamber. The pre-and post-hybridization was carried out using the the TIGR SOP #M008.

    <Summary>
Cell to cell communication in bacteria to regulate various cellular processes with respect to their population density is termed quorum sensing and is achieved using signaling molecules called autoinducers. LuxS, which is involved in the synthesis of the autoinducer molecule-2 (AI-2), is conserved in several Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria including the enteric pathogen Salmonella Typhimurium. Genes that are regulated by luxS in S. Typhimurium were identified using microarrays and RNA samples from wild type S. Typhimurium  and its isogenic luxS mutant, in two growth conditions (presence and absence of glucose), and at two different time points (mid-log and early-stationary phases).  Minimal differential gene expression was observed in the presence of glucose.  In the absence of both luxS and glucose, a total of 1560 genes were differentially expressed and 1361 genes were identified as luxS/AI-2-regulated at the mid-log phase and 199 genes at the early-stationary phase. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on selected genes to validate the microarray results. These results suggest that although the expression of the luxS gene in S. Typhimurium is independent of the growth condition, its role in the production of AI-2 depends on the growth condition. It was found that luxS/AI-2 plays a vital role in a variety of processes such as metabolism, virulence gene expression, motility, transcription and translation.
