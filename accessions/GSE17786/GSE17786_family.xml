Cells were chilled in dry ice/ethanol, centrifuged, and the pellet resuspended in RNA Later (Qiagen) before storing at –80 C. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and DNA was removed by digestion with RNase-Free DNase I. RNA quality and concentration was checked with an Agilent bioanalyzer at the University of Florida Gene Expression core before submitting the RNA to Roche Nimblegen in Iceland for analysis.

    <Summary>
The data explore the transcriptional response of strain LY180 and the furfural-resistant derivative EMFR9 to 0.5 g/L furfural
LY180 and EMFR9 and differences in their expression profiles are described in Miller, E. N., L. R. Jarboe, L. P. Yomano, S. W. York, K. T. Shanmugam, and L. O. Ingram. 2009. Silencing of NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase genes (yqhD and dkgA) in furfural-resistant ethanologenic Escherichia coli. Appl Environ Microbiol 75:4315-23.  The response of LY180 to furfural is described in Miller, E. N., L. R. Jarboe, P. C. Turner, P. Pharkya, L. P. Yomano, S. W. York, D. Nunn, K. T. Shanmugam, and L. O. Ingram. 2009. Furfural Inhibits Growth by Limiting Sulfur Assimilation in Ethanologenic Escherichia coli strain LY180. Appl Environ Microbiol., 2009.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Total RNA was prepared from cultures of LY180 and EMFR9 immediately before and 15 min after addition of furfural to 0.5 g/L.  The Nimblegen TI83333 chip measures expression of 4,237 genes, with 5 replicates, and 18 probes average per gene.

Data from replicate 1 (OID 8641) and replicate 2 (OID 14117) was analyzed independently.
