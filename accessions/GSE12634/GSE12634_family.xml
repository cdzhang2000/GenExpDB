In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

Two individual differentially labeled cDNAs were incubated at 95° C for 3' cooled down to 68° C and mixed (final-volume 20 µl). To these mixed cDNAs 180 µl of pre-heated (68° C) Slidehyb#1 hybridization buffer (Ambion Austin USA) was added and the resulting solution was applied on a pre-heated slide (68° C). Slides were then hybridized at 44° C for 16 hours. Subsequently slides were washed at 42°C once in 1 x SSC/0.2% SDS and twice in 1 x SSC and dried by centrifugation (1 x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl and 0.15 M Sodium Citrate).

In three independent experiments, cultures of the wild-type and recA mutant strain were grown in 50 ml BHI broth (250 ml conical flasks, 37 ºC, 200 rpm,) until an absorbance (OD600) of approximately 0.5 was obtained. At that moment 1 mM MMC (Sigma) was added to the cultures. Ten ml samples were taken before exposure to MMC and one hour afterwards, and dissolved in 20 ml RNAprotect (Qiagen). The mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, centrifuged for 10 min at 4300 rpm (Heraeus type megafuse 1.0R), and the pellets were stored at -80 ºC. The cell pellets were washed in 400 µl SET buffer (50 mM NaCl [Sigma], 5 mM EDTA [Sigma], and 30 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.0; Sigma]) containing 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate (Sigma) and treated for 30 min at 37 ºC in a shaker (350 rpm; Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort) with 200 µl 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.5) containing 50 mg/ml lysozyme (Merck), 2 mg/ml Proteinase K (Ambion), 2.5 U/ml mutanolysin (Ambion), and 4 U/ml SUPERase (Ambion). Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) with an on column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The quality of the RNA was analyzed on a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and quantified on a ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies).

    <Title>Listeria monocytogenes SOS response determined after mitomycin C exposure</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE12634</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19892760</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The SOS response is a conserved pathway that is activated under certain stress conditions and is regulated by the repressor LexA and the activator RecA. The food-borne pathogen Listeria monocytogenes contains RecA and LexA homologs, but their roles in Listeria have not been established. In this study, we identified the SOS regulon in L. monocytogenes by comparing the transcription profiles of the wild-type strain and the ΔrecA mutant strain after exposure to the DNA damaging agent mitomycinC (MMC). The SOS response is an inducible pathway involved in DNA repair, restart of stalled replication forks, and in induction of genetic variation in stressed and stationary phase cells. It is regulated by LexA and RecA. LexA is an autoregulatory repressor which binds to a consensus sequence in the promoter region of the SOS response genes, thereby repressing transcription. A consensus LexA binding motif for L. monocytogenes has not been identified thus far. Generally, the SOS response is induced under circumstances in which single stranded DNA accumulates in the cell. This results in activation of  RecA, which in turn stimulates cleavage of LexA, and ultimately in the induction of the SOS response.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Triple loop design of 3 independent experiments (series A, B, and C) using Wt strain and recA mutant (activator of the SOS response).  Sampling was done before (t=0) and 1 hour after (t=60) exposure to mitomycin C (MMC) for both the wild-type strain and the recA mutant strain. One series therefore contains 4 samples and the complete experiments consists of 12 samples. Each of the 3 series was designed in a loop (wt, t=0 =&gt;wt, t=60 =&gt; recA, t=60 =&gt; recA, t=0 =&gt; wt, t=0). These 3 loops were connected using series B as the central loop. Series B was connected to series A as follows: wt, t=0 (B) =&gt; recA, t=0 (A) and wt, t=60 (B) =&gt; recA, t=60 (A). Series B was connected to series C as follows: recA, t=0 (B) =&gt; wt, t=0 (C) and recA, t=60 (B) =&gt; wt, t=60 (C).
