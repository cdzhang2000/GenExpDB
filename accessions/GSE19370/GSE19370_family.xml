At steady-state, peroxynitrite was added to the chemostat culture and to the nutrient feed at a final concentration of 300 uM. Samples were removed immediately prior to and 5 minutes after injection of peroxynitrite
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was grown in a New Brunswick Scientific Bioflow III Biofermentor under continuous culture (chemostat) conditions. Cells were grown in defined media containing 2 mM glycerol as the sole and limiting source of energy and carbon. The working volume was 1 litre, and the dilution rate 0.2 h-1. For aerobic growth, the air-flow rate was 1 l/min, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained at 40% air saturation

      <Extract-Protocol>
Samples (10 ml) were harvested directly into RNA Protect (Qiagen) to stabilize RNA, and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit as recommended by the suppliers.  RNA was quantified using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf).

      <Label-Protocol>
The labelling procedure uses equal quantities of RNA from adequate hydrogen peroxide and control samples
Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 ml of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 ml dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 ml 0.1 M DTT, 2 ml 1 mM Cy5 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 ml Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 ml of 1M) and HCl (7.5 ml of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 ml).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample and re-suspended in 120 ml salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 1× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).

    <Data-Processing>
Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 ml of 1M) and HCl (7.5 ml of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 ml).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample and re-suspended in 120 ml salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 1× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).

Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
At steady-state, hydrogen peroxide was added to the chemostat culture and to the nutrient feed at a final concentration of 300 uM. Samples were removed immediately prior to and 5 minutes after injection of hydrogen peroxide
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was grown in a New Brunswick Scientific Bioflow III Biofermentor under continuous culture (chemostat) conditions. Cells were grown in defined media containing 2 mM glycerol as the sole and limiting source of energy and carbon. The working volume was 1 litre, and the dilution rate 0.2 h-1. For aerobic growth, the air-flow rate was 1 l/min, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained at 40% air saturation

      <Extract-Protocol>
Samples (10 ml) were harvested directly into RNA Protect (Qiagen) to stabilize RNA, and total RNA was purified using Qiagen’s RNeasy Mini kit as recommended by the suppliers.  RNA was quantified using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf).

      <Label-Protocol>
The labelling procedure uses equal quantities of RNA from adequate hydrogen peroxide and control samples
Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 ml of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 ml dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 ml 0.1 M DTT, 2 ml 1 mM Cy5 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 ml Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 ml of 1M) and HCl (7.5 ml of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 ml).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample and re-suspended in 120 ml salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 1× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
At steady-state, hydrogen peroxide was added to the chemostat culture and to the nutrient feed at a final concentration of 300 uM. Samples were removed immediately prior to and 5 minutes after injection of hydrogen peroxide
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Escherichia coli strain MG1655 was grown in a New Brunswick Scientific Bioflow III Biofermentor under continuous culture (chemostat) conditions. Cells were grown in defined media containing 2 mM glycerol as the sole and limiting source of energy and carbon. The working volume was 1 litre, and the dilution rate 0.2 h-1. For aerobic growth, the air-flow rate was 1 l/min, and the dissolved oxygen tension was maintained at 40% air saturation

The labelling procedure uses equal quantities of RNA from adequate hydrogen peroxide and control samples
Approximately 9 µg RNA was annealed to 4.5 µg pd(N)6 random hexamers (Amersham Biosciences) by heating at 65 oC for 10 min, followed by 10 min at 22 oC and cooling on ice for 2 min. This was supplemented with 6 ml of 5× First-strand buffer (Invitrogen), 2.5 ml dNTP mixture (5 mM each dATP, dTTP, dGTP and 2 mM dCTP), 3 ml 0.1 M DTT, 2 ml 1 mM Cy5 (Perkin Elmer) and 1.5 ml Superscript III reverse transcriptase (200 U) (Invitrogen).  This was incubated at 42 oC for 3 hours.  The reaction was terminated by the addition of NaOH (7.5 ml of 1M) and HCl (7.5 ml of 1M) before the addition of TE buffer (300 ml).  Labelled cDNA was purified using a Qiaquick purification kit (Qiagen).

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The Cy3-dCTP-labelled sample was mixed with the Cy5-dCTP-labelled sample and re-suspended in 120 ml salt-based hybridisation buffer (supplied with the microarray slides).  This was heated at 95 oC for 3 min then cooled on ice for 3 min.  The mixture was pipetted onto a microarray slide, sealed with a GeneFrame and coverslip in a hybridization chamber and incubated for 18 h at 42 °C.  Following hybridization, microarray slides (minus GeneFrame and coverslip) were washed in a series of pre-warmed (37 °C) SSC buffers for 5 min each at 37oC: 1× SSC/0.1 % SDS, 1× SSC, 0.2× SSC and 0.01× SSC.  Microarray slides were dried by centrifugation at 500 × g for 2 min before scanning.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned on an Affymetrix 428 scanner.  The average signal intensity and local background correction were obtained using a commercially available software package from Biodiscovery, Inc (Imagene, version 4.0 and GeneSight, version 3.5).

Spots automatically flagged as bad, negative or poor in the Imagene software were removed before the statistical analysis was carried out in GeneSight.  The mean values from each channel were log2 transformed and normalised using the Lowess method to remove intensity-dependent effects in the log2(ratios) values.  The Cy3/Cy5 fluorescent ratios were calculated from the normalized values.

    <Summary>
Peroxynitrite is formed in macrophages by the diffusion-limited reaction of superoxide and nitric oxide. This highly reactive species is capable of causing both oxidative and nitrosative stress in Escherichia coli. Previous studies have focused on the reactions of peroxynitrite with specific proteins or the effects of peroxynitrite on the growth and viability of whole cells. This work shows for the first time the transcriptomic response of E. coli to peroxynitrite, highlighting specific areas targeted by the stress. Upregulation of the cysteine biosynthesis pathway and subsequent identification of an increase in S-nitrosothiol levels suggests S-nitrosylation as a consequence of peroxynitrite exposure. Genes involved in the assembly / repair of iron-sulfur clusters also show enhanced transcription identifying another target of this reactive species. Unexpectedly arginine biosynthesis gene transcription levels were also elevated after treatment with peroxynitrite. Analysis of the negative regulator for these genes, ArgR, showed that the post-translational nitration of tyrosine residues within this protein is responsible for its degradation in vitro. Further upregulation is seen in oxidative stress response genes including katG and ahpCF. Probabilistic modelling of this data identified 5 altered transcription factors in response to peroxynitrite exposure including OxyR and ArgR. Hydrogen peroxide can be present as a contaminant in commercially available peroxynitrite preparations. Transcriptomic analysis of cells treated with hydrogen peroxide also showed an upregulation of oxidative stress response genes; however it did not show increased transcription of many other genes which are upregulated by peroxynitrite suggesting that cellular responses to peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide are distinct.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Biological experiments (i.e. a comparison of control and plus peroxynitrite cells) were carried out three times, and a dye swap performed for each experiment, providing two technical repeats for each of the three biological repeats.  Data from the independent experiments were combined. Genes that were differentially expressed ≥ twofold and displayed and P value of &lt; 0.05 (as determined by a t test) were defined as being statistically significantly differentially transcribed.
