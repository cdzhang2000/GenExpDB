    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 29-Jan-2002.
Contains probes for more than 4,200 known open reading frames of E. coli.  Also contains probe sets for stable RNA species as well as intergenic regions that do not correspond to known ORFs.
Sequence information for probes corresponds to the M54 version of E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.  Sequences corresponding to both characterized genes and those whose function is unknown can be identified according to the numbering convention used by the E. coli Genome Project database.
Keywords = high density oligonucleotide array

        <Description>Indicates whether the sequence is an Exemplar, Consensus or Control sequence. An Exemplar is a single nucleotide sequence taken directly from a public database. This sequence could be an mRNA or EST. A Consensus sequence, is a nucleotide sequence assembled by Affymetrix, based on one or more sequence taken from a public database.</Description>

        <Description>The accession number of a representative sequence. Note that for consensus-based probe sets, the representative sequence is only one of several sequences (sequence sub-clusters) used to build the consensus sequence and it is not directly used to derive the probe sequences. The representative sequence is chosen during array design as a sequence that is best associated with the transcribed region being interrogated by the probe set.

    <Description>
Overnight culture was diluted 1000-fold with fresh LB medium and cultured further.  Log phase culture was diluted to a cell density of 2 X 108 cells/ml in M9 salts and incubated at 37°C for two hours, after which it was resuspended in LB broth for 90 minutes.  This treatment served as a mock treatment for cultures incubated with a chemical in a parallel study. Total RNA was isolated from cells by extraction using the MasterPure RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Technologies) followed by DNAse digestion according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  The isolated total RNA was quantitated by absorption at 260 nm (typical yield from a 15 ml culture was 250-500 µg of total RNA), and the purity was determined by the ratio of absorption values at 260/280nm.  RNA quality was determined by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2% agarose in FA Buffer pH 7.0 (20 mM 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM ethylenadiaminetetraacetic acide (EDTA))) or by analysis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  All samples visualized by gel electrophoresis or by the bioanalyzer electropherogram showed clear distinct bands correlating to 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA, indicating that no detectable RNA degradation occurred and that RNA integrity was maintained throughout the RNA isolation procedure. mRNA was enriched from total RNA as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual for GeneChip E. coli Sense Genome Arrays.

    <Description>
Overnight culture was diluted 1000-fold with fresh LB medium and cultured further.  Log phase culture was diluted to a cell density of 2 X 108 cells/ml in M9 salts and incubated at 37°C for two hours, after which it was resuspended in LB broth for 90 minutes.  This treatment served as a mock treatment for cultures incubated with a chemical in a parallel study. Total RNA was isolated from cells by extraction using the MasterPure RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Technologies) followed by DNAse digestion according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  The isolated total RNA was quantitated by absorption at 260 nm (typical yield from a 15 ml culture was 250-500 µg of total RNA), and the purity was determined by the ratio of absorption values at 260/280nm.  RNA quality was determined by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2% agarose in FA Buffer pH 7.0 (20 mM 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM ethylenadiaminetetraacetic acide (EDTA))) or by analysis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  All samples visualized by gel electrophoresis or by the bioanalyzer electropherogram showed clear distinct bands correlating to 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA, indicating that no detectable RNA degradation occurred and that RNA integrity was maintained throughout the RNA isolation procedure. mRNA was enriched from total RNA as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual for GeneChip E. coli Sense Genome Arrays.

    <Description>
Overnight culture was diluted 1000-fold with fresh LB medium and cultured further.  Log phase culture was diluted to a cell density of 2 X 108 cells/ml in M9 salts and incubated at 37°C for two hours, after which it was resuspended in LB broth for 90 minutes.  This treatment served as a mock treatment for cultures incubated with a chemical in a parallel study. Total RNA was isolated from cells by extraction using the MasterPure RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Technologies) followed by DNAse digestion according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  The isolated total RNA was quantitated by absorption at 260 nm (typical yield from a 15 ml culture was 250-500 µg of total RNA), and the purity was determined by the ratio of absorption values at 260/280nm.  RNA quality was determined by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2% agarose in FA Buffer pH 7.0 (20 mM 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM ethylenadiaminetetraacetic acide (EDTA))) or by analysis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  All samples visualized by gel electrophoresis or by the bioanalyzer electropherogram showed clear distinct bands correlating to 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA, indicating that no detectable RNA degradation occurred and that RNA integrity was maintained throughout the RNA isolation procedure. mRNA was enriched from total RNA as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual for GeneChip E. coli Sense Genome Arrays.

    <Overall-Design>
Overnight cultures were diluted 1000-fold with fresh LB medium and cultured further.  Log phase cultures were diluted to a cell density of 2 X 108 cells/ml in M9 salts and incubated at 37°C for two hours, after which they were resuspended in LB broth for 90 minutes.  This treatment served as a mock treatment for cultures incubated with a chemical (cisplatin) in a parallel study (Robbins et al., unpublished results). Total RNA was isolated from cells by extraction using the MasterPure RNA Purification Kit (Epicentre Technologies) followed by DNAse digestion according to the manufacturer’s protocol.  The isolated total RNA was quantitated by absorption at 260 nm (typical yield from a 15 ml culture was 250-500 µg of total RNA), and the purity was determined by the ratio of absorption values at 260/280nm.  RNA quality was determined by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis (1.2% agarose in FA Buffer pH 7.0 (20 mM 3-[N-morpholino]propanesulfonic acid, 5 mM sodium acetate, 1 mM ethylenadiaminetetraacetic acide (EDTA))) or by analysis on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer.  All samples visualized by gel electrophoresis or by the bioanalyzer electropherogram showed clear distinct bands correlating to 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA, indicating that no detectable RNA degradation occurred and that RNA integrity was maintained throughout the RNA isolation procedure. mRNA was enriched from total RNA as described in the Affymetrix GeneChip Expression Analysis Technical Manual for GeneChip E. coli Sense Genome Arrays.
