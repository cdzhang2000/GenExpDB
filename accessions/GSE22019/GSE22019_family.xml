      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Cells were pelleted and stored at -20ºC until RNA extraction, using the Ambion MirVANA RNA kit (Austin, TX). RNA quantity and quality was assessed by measuring total RNA using a nanodrop 1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific) and visualizing RNA on an agarose gel.  Purified RNA was stored at -80 degree Celsius.

      <Label-Protocol>
DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 µg of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 µg of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70°C for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA)

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Aminosilane-coated slides were prehybridized in 5x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) (Invitrogen), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42°C for 60 min.  The slides then were washed at room temperature with distilled water, dipped in isopropanol, and allowed to dry.  Equal volumes of the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined, dried and then resuspended in a solution of 40% formamide, 5x SSC, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Resuspended probes were heated to 95ºC prior to hybridization.  The probe mixture then was added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize overnight at 42°C.   Hybridized slides were washed sequentially in solutions of 1x SSC-0.2% SDS, 0.1x SSC-0.2% SDS, and 0.1x SSC at room temperature, then dried in air.

    <Data-Processing>
Individual TIFF images from each channel were analyzed with TIGR Spotfinder (available at (http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/bioinformatics.html). Microarray data were normalized by LOWESS normalization and with in-slide replicate analysis using TM4 software MIDAS (available at (http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/bioinformatics.html)). The mev file generated from MIDAS were used to generate the data table, where VALUE is the log2 (QUERY/REF), i.e., the base 2 logarithm of the ratio of QUERY_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY over REF_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY, QUERY_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY is the geometric mean of the integrated intensities (IA or IB) of in-slide replicates for the query channel, and REF_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY is the geometric mean of the integrated intensities (IA or IB) of in-slide replicates for the reference channel.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 µg of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 µg of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70°C for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA)

Aminosilane-coated slides were prehybridized in 5x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) (Invitrogen), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42°C for 60 min.  The slides then were washed at room temperature with distilled water, dipped in isopropanol, and allowed to dry.  Equal volumes of the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined, dried and then resuspended in a solution of 40% formamide, 5x SSC, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Resuspended probes were heated to 95ºC prior to hybridization.  The probe mixture then was added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize overnight at 42°C.

    <Data-Processing>
Individual TIFF images from each channel were analyzed with TIGR Spotfinder (available at (http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/bioinformatics.html). Microarray data were normalized by LOWESS normalization and with in-slide replicate analysis using TM4 software MIDAS (available at (http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/bioinformatics.html)). The mev file generated from MIDAS were used to generate the data table, where VALUE is the log2 (QUERY/REF), i.e., the base 2 logarithm of the ratio of QUERY_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY over REF_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY, QUERY_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY is the geometric mean of the integrated intensities (IA or IB) of in-slide replicates for the query channel, and REF_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY is the geometric mean of the integrated intensities (IA or IB) of in-slide replicates for the reference channel.

    <Description>
Aminosilane-coated slides were prehybridized in 5x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) (Invitrogen), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42°C for 60 min.  The slides then were washed at room temperature with distilled water, dipped in isopropanol, and allowed to dry.  Equal volumes of the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined, dried and then resuspended in a solution of 40% formamide, 5x SSC, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Resuspended probes were heated to 95ºC prior to hybridization.  The probe mixture then was added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize overnight at 42°C.   Hybridized slides were washed sequentially in solutions of 1x SSC-0.2% SDS, 0.1x SSC-0.2% SDS, and 0.1x SSC at room temperature, then dried in air, and scanned with an Axon GenePix 4000 scanner (http://intranet.jtc.jcvsf.org/sops/M008.pdf).  All wash buffers were supplemented with 1-ml of 0.1M DTT per liter of wash buffer.

    <Data-Processing>
Individual TIFF images from each channel were analyzed with TIGR Spotfinder (available at (http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/bioinformatics.html). Microarray data were normalized by LOWESS normalization and with in-slide replicate analysis using TM4 software MIDAS (available at (http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/bioinformatics.html)). The mev file generated from MIDAS were used to generate the data table, where VALUE is the log2 (QUERY/REF), i.e., the base 2 logarithm of the ratio of QUERY_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY over REF_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY, QUERY_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY is the geometric mean of the integrated intensities (IA or IB) of in-slide replicates for the query channel, and REF_INTEGRATED_INTENSITY is the geometric mean of the integrated intensities (IA or IB) of in-slide replicates for the reference channel.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 µg of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 µg of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70°C for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA)

    <Title>Peptide alarmone signalling triggers an auto-active bacteriocin necessary for genetic competence</Title>

    <Summary>
The induction of genetic competence is a strategy used by bacteria to increase their genetic repertoire under stressful environmental conditions. Recently, Streptococcus pneumoniae has been shown to co-ordinate the uptake of transforming DNA with fratricide via increased expression of the peptide pheromone responsible for competence induction. Here, we document that environmental stress-induced expression of the peptide pheromone competence-stimulating peptide (CSP) in the oral pathogen Streptococcus mutans. We showed that CSP is involved in the stress response and determined the CSP-induced regulon in S. mutans by microarray analysis. Contrary to pneumococcus, S. mutans responds to increased concentrations of CSP by cell lysis in only a fraction of the population. We have focused on the mechanism of cell lysis and have identified a novel bacteriocin as the ‘death effector’. Most importantly, we showed that this bacteriocin causes cell death via a novel mechanism of action: intracellular action against self. We have also identified the cognate bacteriocin immunity protein, which resides in a separate unlinked genetic locus to allow its differential regulation. The role of the lytic response in S. mutans competence is also discussed. Together, these findings reveal a novel autolytic pathway in S. mutans which may be involved in the dissemination of fitness-enhancing genes in the oral biofilm.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Streptococcus mutans UA159 were grown with 2 uM CSP or without (uninduced control) to mid-log phase. Total RNA was extracted as described above. The cDNAs were prepared for hybridization using the PFGRC protocol. Microarray chips were scanned using a Gene Pix 4000B (Axon) and analyzed using the TM4 Microarray Software Suite (http://www.tm4.org/). Transcript levels were measured by cDNA hybridized to a fourfold redundant S. mutans microarray and averaged for three replicated hybridizations. Differential gene expression was based on a post-normalization cut-off of ±&gt; twofold.
