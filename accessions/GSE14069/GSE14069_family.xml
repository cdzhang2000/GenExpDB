20 micrograms total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the use of SuperScript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase and random primers (Invitrogen, USA, 150 ng/µl final concentration) in the presence of 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.15 mM dTTP (GE Healthcare, USA), and 0.15 mM of aminoallyl-dUTP (Sigma, USA). The reaction was allowed to proceed for two hours at 42°C. To stop the reaction and hydrolyse the remaining RNA sodium hydroxide was added to a final concentration of 160 mM and the samples were heated at 65 oC for 15 minutes. The samples were neutralised and the cDNA was purified using the CyScribe™ GFX purification kit (GE Healthcare, USA). Aminoallyl labelled cDNA then underwent a chemical reaction with Cy3 or Cy5 monofunctional NHS-Esters (GE Healthcare, USA). This reaction was stopped by the addition of hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 1.24 M. Labelled samples were then purified using the CyScribe™ GFX purification kit (GE Healthcare, USA). Purified labelled cDNA was dried in a speed vac, just until dry, and then resuspended to a final volume of 9 µl including 45 µg of calf thymus DNA (Sigma, USA) and 45 µg of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen, USA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Eighty-one micro-litres of prewarmed AdvaHybC™ hybridisation solution (Advalytix, Germany) was added to each sample. The samples were then denatured at 95oC for 3 minutes then cooled to 42oC. The samples were loaded onto the microarrays and incubated in the SlideBooster™ (Advalytix, Germany) at 42oC overnight. After hybridisation, the microarray was washed 3 times for 10 to 15 minutes in 1× SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution at 50°C after removal of the coverslip in room-temperature 1× SSC. The slide was rinsed in room temperature 1× SSC, then 0.1× SSC. The slide was dried at 25×g for 5 minutes. 
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using the Agilent G2565BA scanner; this yielded two 16-bit TIFF images per array, one corresponding to the Cy3 channel and one corresponding to the Cy5 channel. These images were then quantified using GenePix Pro 3.0 (Molecular Devices, USA). 
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Before normalization, each individual array spot was pruned to exclude bad or empty spots flagged by GenePix Pro 3.0. Normalization was preformed using the LOWESS algorithm.  For each point, three biological and two technical replicates were measured, resulting in a maximum of 6 gene expression values per gene per treatment. 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Signal intensities were averaged among the technical replicates.  Two types of data analysis were performed: to indentify density-dependent changes in gene expression, single averaged normalized signal intensities for each treatment point were compared to the average of corresponding unstressed control signal intensities.  Genes which showed a relative signal log2ratio (SLR) value above 1.0 or below -1.0 were selected for further analysis.

20 micrograms total RNA was reverse-transcribed with the use of SuperScript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase and random primers (Invitrogen, USA, 150 ng/µl final concentration) in the presence of 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.15 mM dTTP (GE Healthcare, USA), and 0.15 mM of aminoallyl-dUTP (Sigma, USA). The reaction was allowed to proceed for two hours at 42°C. To stop the reaction and hydrolyse the remaining RNA sodium hydroxide was added to a final concentration of 160 mM and the samples were heated at 65 oC for 15 minutes. The samples were neutralised and the cDNA was purified using the CyScribe™ GFX purification kit (GE Healthcare, USA). Aminoallyl labelled cDNA then underwent a chemical reaction with Cy3 or Cy5 monofunctional NHS-Esters (GE Healthcare, USA). This reaction was stopped by the addition of hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 1.24 M. Labelled samples were then purified using the CyScribe™ GFX purification kit (GE Healthcare, USA). Purified labelled cDNA was dried in a speed vac, just until dry, and then resuspended to a final volume of 9 µl including 45 µg of calf thymus DNA (Sigma, USA) and 45 µg of yeast tRNA (Invitrogen, USA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Eighty-one micro-litres of prewarmed AdvaHybC™ hybridisation solution (Advalytix, Germany) was added to each sample. The samples were then denatured at 95oC for 3 minutes then cooled to 42oC. The samples were loaded onto the microarrays and incubated in the SlideBooster™ (Advalytix, Germany) at 42oC overnight. After hybridisation, the microarray was washed 3 times for 10 to 15 minutes in 1× SSC, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution at 50°C after removal of the coverslip in room-temperature 1× SSC. The slide was rinsed in room temperature 1× SSC, then 0.1× SSC. The slide was dried at 25×g for 5 minutes.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using the Agilent G2565BA scanner; this yielded two 16-bit TIFF images per array, one corresponding to the Cy3 channel and one corresponding to the Cy5 channel. These images were then quantified using GenePix Pro 3.0 (Molecular Devices, USA). 
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Before normalization, each individual array spot was pruned to exclude bad or empty spots flagged by GenePix Pro 3.0. Normalization was preformed using the LOWESS algorithm. For each point, three biological and two technical replicates were measured, resulting in a maximum of 6 gene expression values per gene per treatment. 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Signal intensities were averaged among the technical replicates. Two types of data analysis were performed: to indentify density-dependent changes in gene expression, single averaged normalized signal intensities for each treatment point were compared to the average of corresponding unstressed control signal intensities. Genes which showed a relative signal log2ratio (SLR) value above 1.0 or below -1.0 were selected for further analysis.

    <Title>Microarray Analysis of Acid-Stress Induced Changes in EHEC O157:H7 </Title>

    <Summary>
While significant advances have been made in EHEC pathogenesis, we still do not fully understand the impact of environmental stress on EHEC virulence. During the course of infection, EHEC must evade or overcome several biological barriers, the first of which is the gastric acidity encountered during passage through the stomach.  EHEC is remarkable in its ability to tolerate this acidity.  There are four different acid resistance systems that provide E. coli O157:H7 protection against exposure to low pH (2-2.5). Interestingly, EHEC uses these acid resistance systems differentially for survival in foods versus the bovine intestinal tract. The glutamate-dependent acid-resistance system is thought to offer the best protection below pH 3.  Since the infectious dose of EHEC is so low (50-100 organisms), acid resistance becomes an important virulence trait.

Studies of EHEC response to acid stress have focused primarily on levels of acid tolerance and the molecular basis of tolerance. However, the impact of acid stress on EHEC virulence is less well understood. In the related pathogen, EPEC, the plasmid-encoded regulator, Per, that regulates expression of many EPEC virulence factors, is regulated negatively at pH 5.5 and positively at pH 8.0, suggesting that virulence gene expression is repressed during mild acid stress and enhanced in alkaline pH typical of the small intestine. Expression of EPEC type III secreted factors involved in A/E lesion formation has been shown to be influenced by factors including culture media, iron and calcium levels. Protein secretion was inhibited at pH 6 and 8.  In a third study, a gadE (encoding acid resistance regulator) mutation resulted in increased adhesion of E.coli O157:H7 to colonic epithelial cells, suggesting negative regulation of one or more adhesins.  Other studies have reported that shiga toxin production is sensitive to culture conditions including pH. However, there are no studies of EHEC virulence changes after more severe acid stress nor studies linking stressed EHEC virulence phenotype with transcriptional changes. 

The goal of this study was to determine how acid stress affects EHEC virulence properties and through microarray analysis, define the genetic basis for these changes.  Understanding how acid stress modulates the virulence potential of this pathogen is essential for delineating the pathogenesis of disease caused by EHEC infection and may offer novel approaches to prevent and treat EHEC infections.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Bacteria were grown in LB broth overnight, then subcultured into DMEM and grown at 37C, 5%Co2. Bacteria were then subjected to one of three acid stress protocols: 1) UA30: growth in DMEM pH 7.4 followed by growth in DMEM pH 3.0 for 30 minutes; 2) AA30: growth in DMEM pH 5.0 (adaptation) followed by growth in DMEM pH 3.0; 3) UA15: growth in DMEM pH 7.4 followed by growth in DMEM pH 3.0 for 15 minutes.
DMEM was supplemented with 25 mM MES (pH 5.0) and in the case of the control (unadapted, unshocked) 25 mM MOPS (pH 7.4) and the adaptation step was again carried out at 37C and 5% CO2.  Acid shocking was done at pH 3.0 (unbuffered) at room temperature for all treatments
