Total bacterial RNA was extracted from 3 ml of culture which was mixed with 6 ml of bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min in swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge to collect the cells. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and the cells were broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds. From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNase treated and purified mRNA was used for microarray analysis.

cDNA was generated by using random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers for reverse transcription. The primers were annealed (70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min) to total RNA (2 μg) and were extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM dNTP/ aa-UTP (Ambion, Austin, TX) mix at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The labeled cDNA was purified (Qiagen PCR purification kit) and hybridized with Salmonella Typhimurium/Typhi version 8 genome microarrays obtained from Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center (National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases). Briefly, the slides were prehybridized in a buffer containing 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA, and then washed and blown to dry. The two differentially labelled cDNA samples were dried and the resuspended in hybridization solution [40% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 µg/µl sheared Salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)]. The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h. After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC) for 10 min.

Genes analyzed using these programs were further sorted and grouped based on their function using our in-house software Salmonella Gene Sorter (SAGS).

    <Data-Processing>
Scans were analyzed using TIGR-Spotfinder (www.tigr.org/software/) software and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalized by applying the LOWESS algorithm using TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software/) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/reference signal for each spot was recorded. Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded. The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html software using one class mode.

Total bacterial RNA was extracted from 3 ml of culture which was mixed with 6 ml of bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min in swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge to collect the cells. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and the cells were broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds. From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and the cells were broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds. From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNase treated and purified mRNA was used for microarray analysis.

cDNA was generated by using random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers for reverse transcription. The primers were annealed (70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min) to total RNA (2 μg) and were extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM dNTP/ aa-UTP (Ambion, Austin, TX) mix at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Briefly, the slides were prehybridized in a buffer containing 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA, and then washed and blown to dry. The two differentially labelled cDNA samples were dried and the resuspended in hybridization solution [40% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 µg/µl sheared Salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)]. The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h. After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC) for 10 min.

Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded. The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html software using one class mode.

The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h. After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC) for 10 min.

Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded. The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated.

    <Title>Reduction of Salmonella Typhimurium following exposure to multiple hurdle treatments of heated, acidified organic acid salt solutions occurs via membrane destabilization</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE27922</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>21478311</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The antimicrobial activity of organic acids in combination with non-chemical treatments was evaluated for inactivation of Salmonella Typhimurium. It was observed that the effectiveness of the multiple hurdle treatments were temperature and pH dependent and corresponded to the degree of organic acid lipophilicity. This led to the hypothesis that the loss in viability was due to cell membrane disruption. Evaluation of osmotic response, potassium ion leakage, and transmission electron micrographs confirmed effects on the cell membrane following treatment. Interestingly, all treatments, even those with no affect on viability, such as with sodium acetate, resulted in measurable cellular stress. Microarray experiments explored the specific response of S. Typhimurium to sodium acetate and sodium propionate, the most similar treatments in terms of pKa and ionic strength, and found little difference in the changes in gene expression following either treatment, despite their very different effects on viability. Taken together, the results reported support our hypothesis that following treatment with heated, acidified, organic acid salts, the loss of S. Typhimurium viability is at least in part due to membrane damage and the more lipophilic the organic acid the more effective the treatment. Overall, the data presented here indicate that a combined thermal, acidified sodium propionate treatment can provide a simple, yet effective antimicrobial treatment to combat Salmonella.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We have strategically designed a multiple hurdle intervention employing various organic acid salts [sodium acetate (SA), sodium lactate, and sodium propionate (SP)], pH, and temperature hurdles into one treatment against S. Typhimurium. Previous research in our lab has shown similar treatments to be highly effective against S. Typhimurium. Here, we further investigate the range of effectiveness as well as the mechanism of action behind this multiple hurdle treatment using viability, osmotic response, potassium leakage, and transmission electron microscopy studies.
Total bacterial RNA was isolated as previously described and the RNA samples were then converted to fluorescently-labeled cDNA and hybridized to S. Typhimurium microarrays version 8 (NIAID's Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center).
