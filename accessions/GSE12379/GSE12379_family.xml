1.  Oligos are arrayed in Greiner 384-well flat-bottom plates. Each well contains 600 pmol of 70-mer oligo.
2. Resuspend oligos in water to 20 uM and rearray 5 ÂµL into 384-well, Genetix polystyrene V-bottom plates (cat# X6004).
3. Allow Genetix plates to dry through passive water evaporation in a protected environment (e.g., chemical hood).
4. Before printing, add 5 ÂµL of 1X Printing Buffer to each well. This can be done the night before a print run is started.
5. Seal plates with Corning seals.
6. Incubate at 37Â°C for 30 minutes to aid resuspension of DNA.
7. Shake plates near maximum rotational speed on flat-bed shaker for 1 minute.
8. Centrifuge plates at 2000 rpm for 3 minutes.
9. Remove seals and cover with plate lids. Place in appropriate location of plate cassette. This should be done with first plates just before print run is started to minimize evaporation time before printing. For second and third cassettes, wait until 30 minutes before next cassette is needed to begin centrifugation.
10. Make sure plates rest behind both holding clips in the cassettes. Push plates back into the cassettes as far as they will go, putting them in the proper position for the server arm.
11. After the print run is completed, allow plates to dry through passive evaporation in a protected environment.
12. For each subsequent preparation of these plates for a print run, add water to the wells instead of sodium phosphate buffer. The amount of water should be decreased by 0.25 ÂµL per print run, as this is the amount drawn up by the pin capillary during each dip.

    <Summary>
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a pathogen of global importance, utilizes the ESX-1 protein secretion system to export virulence factors that disarm host macrophages. Although this secretory pathway is critical for virulence, how ESX-1 is regulated is completely unknown. Here we show that EspR (Rv3849) is a key regulator of ESX-1. EspR activates transcription of an operon that includes three ESX-1 components, Rv3616c-Rv3614c, whose expression in turn promotes secretion of ESX-1 substrates.

Keywords: Strain comparison
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Comparison of the global gene expression of four M.tb strains grown in log phase: Erdman strain of M.tb, espR transposon mutant, the espR transposon mutant complemented with the wild type copy of the espR gene, and the espR transposon mutant complemented with an N-terminal FLAG espR gene.
