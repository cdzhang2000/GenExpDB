50 ml of GM17-broth with 0.5 mg/ml glutamine was inoculated in 4 replicates with 10-20 colonies from agar plates, and these cultures were statically grown at 37°C. Samples for RNA isolation were taken when the cultures reached an optical density (OD600) of 0.3 (mid-log growth). RNA was isolated and purified using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche diagnostics) as described (PMID: 17085554). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Roche diagnostics). RNA was isolated from three replicate cultures. Synthesis, subsequent labeling of cDNA, and microarray hybridization was performed as described (PMID: 17085554 and 15907200).

Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Roche diagnostics). RNA was isolated from three replicate cultures. Synthesis, subsequent labeling of cDNA, and microarray hybridization was performed as described (PMID: 17085554 and 15907200).

      <Label-Protocol>
Synthesis of cDNA and indirect Cy-3/Cy-5-dCTPs labeling of 15–20 µg of total RNA was performed with the CyScribe Post labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization (16 h at 45 °C) of labeled cDNA was performed in Ambion Slidehyb #1 hybridization buffer (Ambion Europe) on superamine glass slides (Array-It; SMMBC), containing technical replicates.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using the Genepix 4200AL DNA micro array slide scanner.
Quantification of the signal of the spots on slides was done with ArrayPro 4.5

    <Summary>
This microarray experiment is part of a study addressing the importance of glutamine metabolism in Streptococcus pneumoniae for the virulence of this bacterium. To be able to gain more insight into the phenotype of a double mutant of glnA (TIGR 4 locus tag SP0502, encoding glutamine synthetase) and glnP (SP1241, encoding a permease component of a glutmine uptake ABC transporter), the transcriptome of this mutant, the glnPA double mutant, was determined in strain S. pneumoniae D39 grown in rich GM17 medium with 0.5 mg/ml glutamine. This revealed a big change in transcriptome in the mutant, especially a lot of amino acid and peptide metabolic genes.
Keywords: transcriptome analysis of D39 wild-type compared with its isogenic glnPA double mutant
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The wild-type strain D39 and its isogenic glnPA double mutant were grown in 4 biological replicates in GM17 with 0.5 mg/ml glutamine to an Optical Density at 600 nm of 0.3. From these cultures samples were prepared for transciptome determination with in-house printed microarrays covering the genomes of several S. pneumoniae species. The wild-type (control, Ch1) was labeled with Cy5 (3 samples) or Cy3 (1 sample) and vice versa for the samples of the glnPA mutant (target, Ch2). Samples were pair-wise compared on glass-microarray slides.
