50 ml of GM17-broth was inoculated in 4 replicates 1:50 with a frozen stock, and these cultures were statically grown at 37°C. Samples for RNA isolation were taken when the cultures reached an optical density (OD600) of 0.3 (mid-log growth). RNA was isolated and purified using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche diagnostics) as described (PMID: 17085554). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Roche diagnostics). RNA was isolated from three replicate cultures. Synthesis, subsequent labeling of cDNA, and microarray hybridization was performed as described (PMID: 17085554 and 15907200).

      <Label>Cy3</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Synthesis of cDNA and indirect Cy-3/Cy-5-dCTPs labeling of 15–20 µg of total RNA was performed with the CyScribe Post labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the supplier's instructions.

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization (16 h at 45 °C) of labeled cDNA was performed in Ambion Slidehyb #1 hybridization buffer (Ambion Europe) on superamine glass slides (Array-It; SMMBC), containing technical replicates.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using the Genepix 4200AL DNA micro array slide scanner.
Quantification of the signal of the spots on slides was done with ArrayPro 4.5

    <Summary>
This study addresses the response of Streptococcus pneumoniae to zinc. The wild-type strain D39 was grown in GM17 and GM17 with 0.25 mM of ZnSO4. The transcriptome under these conditions was compared by using microarrays. 
Keywords: transcriptome analysis of D39 wild-type compared with its isogenic glnPA double mutant
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The wild-type strain D39 was grown in 4 biological replicates in GM17 and in GM17+0.25 mM ZnSO4 to an Optical Density at 600 nm of 0.3. From these cultures samples were prepared for transciptome determination with in-house printed microarrays covering the genomes of several S. pneumoniae species. The GM17 samples (CH1) and GM17+ZnSO4 samples (CH2) were labeled with Cy5 or Cy3. Samples were hybridized to glass-microarray slides. This work is part of a publication that is likely to be released in june/july 2008: 'Opposite effects of Mn2+ and Zn2+ on the PsaR-mediated expression of the virulence genes pcpA, prtA and psaBCA of Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot;
