    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

The cultivations were performed in a Biostat C 15 L bioreactor with the DCU-3 controlling unit and MFCS-win supervisory system (Sartorius) with an initial working volume of 8 L. The mineral salt medium contained per liter: 14.6 g K2HPO4, 3.6 g NaH2PO4 × 2 H2O, 2.0 g Na2SO4, 2.47 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g NH4Cl, 1.0 g (NH4)2-H-citrate, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 g thiamine hydrochloride, 0.1 mL antifoam 204 (Sigma) and 2 mL trace element solution (1). The initial glucose concentration was 40 g L-1. The feed solution contained 650 g L-1 glucose. 2 mL L-1 of sterile filtered 1M MgSO4 were added regularly per OD600=10 increase.
Two precultures were performed in LB medium and mineral salt medium with 10 g L 1 of glucose without antifoam agent consecutively at 37 °C at a rotary shaker at 180 rpm. Main cultivations were started as batch cultures at a temperature of 37 °C. The pH was kept at 7.0 by controlled addition of 25% ammonia solution. At the end of the exponential growth phase (cell dry weight about 16 g L-1) the stirrer rate was lowered from 1000 rpm to 500 rpm, to provoke oxygen limitation by decreased oxygen transfer. Constant glucose feed of 100 g L-1 h-1 was started 15 min after the oxygen drop which was enough to ensure glucose excess during the whole cultivation.

In the oxygen downshift experiment the aim was to study the gene expression profiles in connection to downshift of oxygen supply by step decrease of agitation rate and air supply. E. coli W3110 strain cultivated in 8L fed-batch fermentation and the S1 sample was taken under aerobic conditions 15 min before the oxygen downshift.

The cultivations were performed in a Biostat C 15 L bioreactor with the DCU-3 controlling unit and MFCS-win supervisory system (Sartorius) with an initial working volume of 8 L. The mineral salt medium contained per liter: 14.6 g K2HPO4, 3.6 g NaH2PO4 × 2 H2O, 2.0 g Na2SO4, 2.47 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.5 g NH4Cl, 1.0 g (NH4)2-H-citrate, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 g thiamine hydrochloride, 0.1 mL antifoam 204 (Sigma) and 2 mL trace element solution (1). The initial glucose concentration was 40 g L-1. The feed solution contained 650 g L-1 glucose. 2 mL L-1 of sterile filtered 1M MgSO4 were added regularly per OD600=10 increase.
Two precultures were performed in LB medium and mineral salt medium with 10 g L 1 of glucose without antifoam agent consecutively at 37 °C at a rotary shaker at 180 rpm. Main cultivations were started as batch cultures at a temperature of 37 °C. The pH was kept at 7.0 by controlled addition of 25% ammonia solution. At the end of the exponential growth phase (cell dry weight about 16 g L-1) the stirrer rate was lowered from 1000 rpm to 500 rpm, to provoke oxygen limitation by decreased oxygen transfer. Constant glucose feed of 100 g L-1 h-1 was started 15 min after the oxygen drop which was enough to ensure glucose excess during the whole cultivation.

Samples for microarray analysis were collected as described earlier [1], (Samples were shortly mixed by vortexing, divided in 0.5 mL aliquots and 1. centrifuged for 3 min at 16,100 ×g and +4 °C. The pellets were resuspended in 250 µL of RNALater (Ambion, USA) and stored at -20 °C until analysis. RNA was extracted using the total RNA kit (A&amp;A Biotechnology, Poland) .

    <Description>
In the oxygen downshift experiment the aim was to study the gene expression profiles in connection to downshift of oxygen supply by step decrease of agitation rate and air supply. E. coli W3110 strain cultivated in 8L fed-batch fermentation and the S4 sample was taken under oxygen limitation 75 min after the oxygen downshift.

    <Summary>
Dynamical response to oxygen downshift under fermentation conditions was tested by taking sample before (S1) and after (S2, S3 and S4) the oxygen downshift. The dynamical changes relevant for ongoing research on physiology were applied.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Four microarray chips were analyzed: 

S1 was taken 15 min before the oxygen downshift
S2, S3 and S4 were taken 15 min, 45 min and 75 min after the oxygen downshift, respectively
