      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1.  This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media.  MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL.  MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking.  Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth.  Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h.  After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells.  The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction.  Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.).  Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min.  Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1).  RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2.  RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C.  RNA samples were purified and treated with Dnase using the Rneasy kit

Reverse transcription reactions contained 6ug RNA, 2ug random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 1x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 10mM DTT,  400U Superscript II (Invitrogen), 0.5mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.3mM dTTP, and 0.2mM amino-allyl dUTP.  30uL reactions were incubated overnight at 42C.  cDNA was purified using PCR cleanup columns (Qiagen) with Phosphate wash buffer (5mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0, 80%EtOH) and phosphate elution buffer (4mM K2HPO4, pH 8.5).   Amino-allyl labeled cDNA was dried and resuspended in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.3 and  coupled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.).  Uncoupled dye was removed by another purfication using the PCR cleanup kit.  Concentration of cDNA and amount of incoporated dye was measured for each sample using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Ambion).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour.  After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O.  Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array.  Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h.  After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1.  This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media.  MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL.  MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking.  Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth.  Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h.  After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells.  The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction.  Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.).  Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min.  Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1).  RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2.  RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C.  RNA samples were purified and treated with Dnase using the Rneasy kit

MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction. Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C. RNA samples were purified and treated with Dnase using the Rneasy kit

Reverse transcription reactions contained 6ug RNA, 2ug random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 1x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 10mM DTT, 400U Superscript II (Invitrogen), 0.5mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.3mM dTTP, and 0.2mM amino-allyl dUTP. 30uL reactions were incubated overnight at 42C. cDNA was purified using PCR cleanup columns (Qiagen) with Phosphate wash buffer (5mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0, 80%EtOH) and phosphate elution buffer (4mM K2HPO4, pH 8.5). Amino-allyl labeled cDNA was dried and resuspended in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.3 and coupled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Uncoupled dye was removed by another purfication using the PCR cleanup kit. Concentration of cDNA and amount of incoporated dye was measured for each sample using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Ambion).

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction. Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction. Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C. RNA samples were purified and treated with Dnase using the Rneasy kit

Reverse transcription reactions contained 6ug RNA, 2ug random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 1x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 10mM DTT, 400U Superscript II (Invitrogen), 0.5mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.3mM dTTP, and 0.2mM amino-allyl dUTP. 30uL reactions were incubated overnight at 42C. cDNA was purified using PCR cleanup columns (Qiagen) with Phosphate wash buffer (5mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0, 80%EtOH) and phosphate elution buffer (4mM K2HPO4, pH 8.5). Amino-allyl labeled cDNA was dried and resuspended in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.3 and coupled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Uncoupled dye was removed by another purfication using the PCR cleanup kit. Concentration of cDNA and amount of incoporated dye was measured for each sample using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Ambion).

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction. Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C. RNA samples were purified and treated with Dnase using the Rneasy kit

Reverse transcription reactions contained 6ug RNA, 2ug random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif.), 1x first strand buffer (Invitrogen), 10mM DTT, 400U Superscript II (Invitrogen), 0.5mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.3mM dTTP, and 0.2mM amino-allyl dUTP. 30uL reactions were incubated overnight at 42C. cDNA was purified using PCR cleanup columns (Qiagen) with Phosphate wash buffer (5mM K2HPO4, pH 8.0, 80%EtOH) and phosphate elution buffer (4mM K2HPO4, pH 8.5). Amino-allyl labeled cDNA was dried and resuspended in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.3 and coupled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Uncoupled dye was removed by another purfication using the PCR cleanup kit. Concentration of cDNA and amount of incoporated dye was measured for each sample using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Ambion).

MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction. Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction. Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C.

Amino-allyl labeled cDNA was dried and resuspended in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.3 and coupled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Uncoupled dye was removed by another purfication using the PCR cleanup kit. Concentration of cDNA and amount of incoporated dye was measured for each sample using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Ambion).

      </Characteristics>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

4mL of culture was mixed with 8mL of RNAProtect (Qiagen, Valencia, Calif.), vortexed, and centrifuged at 4C, 7500rpm for 10 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets stored at –70C for 1 week or less before RNA extraction. Cell pellets were suspended in 700uL of 95C lysis buffer (20mM sodium acetate pH 5.2, 2mM EDTA pH 8.0, and 0.5% SDS), held at 95C for 30s then mixed with 700uL of 65C Acid-Phenol: Chloroform, pH 4.5 (with IAA, 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, Tex.). Samples were held at 65C with periodic shaking for at least 6 minutes before centrifuging at 12000 rpm for 10 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated for at least 1 hour at –20C in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA was suspended in 1mM sodium citrate pH 6.5 and stored at –70C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The Sakai strain was inoculated into 10mL of LB broth from freezer stocks and grown to OD600 = 0.1. This ~4h period of growth in LB allowed cells to recover before transfer to MOPS minimal media. MOPS minimal media (10x) was prepared as described in Neidhardt et al. with the addition of 20mL of micronutrient solution instead of 10mL. MOPS minimal media contained 100mL of 10x MOPS minimal media, 10mL of 0.132M K2HPO4, and 5mL of 20% D-glucose per liter. Cultures were inoculated into 50mL of MOPS minimal media with 0.1% glucose at a ratio of 1:200 and grown to stationary phase at 37C with shaking. Cultures in MOPS were transferred to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:75 and grown for 9h before transfer again to 100mL MOPS in 250mL plastic culture flasks at a ratio of 1:30 and this culture was used to sample RNA during growth. Cultures were sampled at 3h (OD600 ≈ 0.22), 4h (OD600 ≈ 0.45), 4.33h (OD600 ≈ 0.73), 4.66h (OD600 ≈ 0.93), 5h (OD600 ≈ 1), 5.5h, 6h, 7h, 7.5h, and 8h. After 5h, the culture density remained at OD600 ≈ 1.

    <Title>Global transcriptional response of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to growth transitions in glucose minimal medium</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE7477</Accession>
    <Summary>
Background: Global patterns of gene expression of Escherichia coli K-12 during growth transitions have been deeply investigated, however, comparable studies of E. coli O157:H7 have not been explored, particularly with respect to factors regulating virulence genes and genomic islands specific to this pathogen. To examine the impact of growth phase on the dynamics of the transcriptome, O157:H7 Sakai strain was cultured in MOPS minimal media (0.1% glucose), RNA harvested at 10 time points from early exponential to full stationary phase, and relative gene expression was measured by co-hybridization on high-density DNA microarrays. 
Results: Analysis of variance (R/MAANOVA, Fs test) identified 442 (36%) of 1239 O157-specific ORFs and 2110 (59%) of 3647 backbone ORFs that changed in expression significantly over time.  QT cluster analysis placed 2468 of the 2552 significant ORFs into 12 groups; each group representing a distinct expression pattern.  ORFs from the largest cluster (n=1078) decreased in expression from late exponential to early stationary phase: most of these ORFs are involved in functions associated with steady state growth.  Also represented in this cluster are ORFs of the TAI island, encoding tellurite resistance and urease activity, which decreased ~4-fold and most ORFs of the LEE island, which decreased ~2-fold by early stationary phase.  ORFs encoding proteins secreted via the LEE encoded type III secretion system, such as tccP and espJ, also decreased in expression from exponential to stationary phase. Three of the clusters (n=154) comprised genes that are transiently upregulated at the transition into stationary phase and included genes involved in nutrient scavenging.  Upregulated genes with an increase in mRNA levels from late exponential to early stationary phase belonged to one cluster (n=923) which includes genes involved in stress responses (e.g. gadAB, osmBC, and dps).  These transcript levels remained relatively high for &gt;3h in stationary phase.  The Shiga toxin genes (stx1AB and stx2B) were significantly induced after transition into stationary phase.
Conclusions:  Expression of 307 O157-specific ORFs was modulated in a growth dependent manner.  These results provide a baseline transcriptional profile that can be compared to patterns of gene expression of this important foodborne pathogen under adverse environmental conditions.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The results are based on O157:H7 Sakai cultures collected from 10 time points of growth in minimal media with 4 replicates at each point for a total of 40 samples. The samples collected from the mid-exponential phase 3-hour time point were used as a common reference for hybridization and analysis for all subsequent time points in a blocked reference design.  This design allowed for indirect comparison between all time points via the 3-hour samples.  We incorporated the dye-swaps among the four biological replicates.
