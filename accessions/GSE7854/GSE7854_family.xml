      <Treatment-Protocol>
Overnight cultures of L. monocytogenes 10403S were inoculated (1:100) into 20 ml of BHI (pH 7) in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask, and incubated at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Growth was monitored by measuring OD600, using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer.
Cells to be subjected to alkali shock (AS) were harvested by centrifugation (8,000g x10min at 4°C) from 20 ml of this culture when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.4. Recovered cells were washed, and immediately resuspended in 20 ml pre-warmed (30°C) pH 9 MBHI (test) or neutral MBHI (pH 7 control) for 15, 30 or 60 min.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted from control and alkaline shock (AS) samples using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In each case, 5 ml samples were mixed with bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen) to stabilise the transcripts, and the cells were recovered by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen), mechanically broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine CA) at a speed setting of 6.0 for 40 seconds, and their lysate RNA was extracted from the cell lysate as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified and residual DNA fragments were removed by DNAase (Qiagen) treatment using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Cy3. Cy5 for flip dye experiment</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA was synthesized from the purified RNA by the Institute of Genomics Research microarray protocol (TIGR). In this process 2 μg of the purified RNA was annealed with random hexamers as primers (Invitrogen) (70°C/5min and snap frozen in ice/1min), and extended overnight at 42°C with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM DNTP/aa-UTP (Ambion) mix. Residual RNA was removed and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then recovered, labelled with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and purified, using Qiagen PCR purification kits following the manufacturers instructions.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Purified labelled L. monocytogenes cDNA from alkali treated and control samples were hybridised on microarray slides consisting of 6347 70-mer oligonucleotides representing Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from L. monocytogenes (Version 1) strains EGD-e, 4b F2365, 1/2a F6854 and 4b H7858, obtained from Pathogen Functional Genomic Research Centre (http://pfgrc.tigr.org).  Before hybridization, microarray slides were pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer at 42˚C for 45 min.  Pre-hybridized slides were washed with water (4 times) and isopropanol (3 times) for 2 min each and dried by centrifugation.  Purified probes were speed-vaced and resuspended in hybridization buffer. The probes in hybridization buffer were applied to the microarray slides covered with lifterslips (Erie Scientific Co.).  Hybridized slides were sealed in a water tight hybridization chamber. These chambers were incubated for 14-16 h in a 42˚C water bath. Hybridized arrays were then washed 2 times with low stringency, medium stringency, and high stringency buffers for 10 min at room temperature using a reciprocal shaking table.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Hybridised slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were stored as single TIFF images.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Several controls were employed to minimise technical and biological variations, and ensure the quality of the data: i) each ORF was present in duplicate in each array, ii) each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two-separate arrays with reversal of incorporated dye and iii) three independent RNA batches from each condition were analysed.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
TIFF images of the hybridised arrays were analysed using the TIGR spotfinder software (www.tigr.org/software), and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalised using the LOWESS  algorithm by the TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/control signal for each spot was recorded. The averaged log2 ratio for each gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (Significance-Analysis-of-Microarrays:
http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/) software using one class mode.

Purified labelled L. monocytogenes cDNA from alkali treated and control samples were hybridised on microarray slides consisting of 6347 70-mer oligonucleotides representing Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from L. monocytogenes (Version 1) strains EGD-e, 4b F2365, 1/2a F6854 and 4b H7858, obtained from Pathogen Functional Genomic Research Centre (http://pfgrc.tigr.org). Before hybridization, microarray slides were pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer at 42˚C for 45 min. Pre-hybridized slides were washed with water (4 times) and isopropanol (3 times) for 2 min each and dried by centrifugation. Purified probes were speed-vaced and resuspended in hybridization buffer. The probes in hybridization buffer were applied to the microarray slides covered with lifterslips (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridized slides were sealed in a water tight hybridization chamber. These chambers were incubated for 14-16 h in a 42˚C water bath. Hybridized arrays were then washed 2 times with low stringency, medium stringency, and high stringency buffers for 10 min at room temperature using a reciprocal shaking table.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Hybridised slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were stored as single TIFF images.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Several controls were employed to minimise technical and biological variations, and ensure the quality of the data: i) each ORF was present in duplicate in each array, ii) each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two-separate arrays with reversal of incorporated dye and iii) three independent RNA batches from each condition were analysed.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
TIFF images of the hybridised arrays were analysed using the TIGR spotfinder software (www.tigr.org/software), and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalised using the LOWESS algorithm by the TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/controlsignal for each spot was recorded. Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded. The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimatelycalculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (Significance-Analysis-of-Microarrays:

    <Title>Transcriptome Analysis of Alkali Shock and Alkali Adaptation in Listeria monocytogenes 10403S</Title>

    <Summary>
Alkali stress is an important means of inactivating undesirable pathogens in a wide range of situations, ranging from environmental cleaning of food processing environments, to the phagolysosomal killing of cells engulfed by mammalian phagocytes. Unfortunately, L. monocytogenes can launch an alkaline tolerance response (AlTR), significantly increasing persistence of the pathogen in such environments. This study compared the transcriptome patterns of alkali stressed and non alkali stressed L. monocytogenes 10403S cells, to elucidate the mechanisms by which this important pathogen adapts and/or grows during short or long-term alkali stress. Transcription profiles associated with alkali shock (AS) responses were obtained by DNA microarray analysis of mid-exponential cells suspended in pH 9 media for 15, 30 or 60 min. Transcription profiles associated with alkali adaptation (AA) were obtained by DNA microarray analysis of cells grown to mid-exponential phase in pH 9 media . Comparison of AS and AA transcription profiles with profiles from control (pH 7.0) cells identified over 2,000 genes that were differentially expressed under alkaline conditions. Rapid (15min) changes in expression included upregulation of genes encoding for multiple metabolic pathways, (including those associated with Na+/H+ antiporters), ABC transporters of functional compatible solutes such as carnitine, motility and virulence-associated genes as well as the σB controlled stress resistance network. Slower (30min and more) responses to AS and adaptation during growth in alkaline conditions (AA), included modest changes in mRNA concentrations, and genes involved in proton export.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Overnight cultures of L. monocytogenes 10403S were inoculated (1:100) into 20 ml of BHI (pH 7) in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask, and incubated at 30°C with shaking at 200 rpm. Growth was monitored by measuring OD600, using a Beckman DU-65 spectrophotometer.
Cells to be subjected to alkali shock (AS) were harvested by centrifugation (8,000g x10min at 4°C) from 20 ml of this culture when the optical density at 600 nm reached 0.4. Recovered cells were washed, and immediately resuspended in 20 ml pre-warmed (30°C) pH 9 MBHI (test) or neutral MBHI (pH 7 control) for 15, 30 or 60 min.
Cells to be examined in terms of alkali adaptation (AA) were produced by inoculation of the overnight culture (1:100) into 20ml of MBHI adjusted at pH 9 (test) or pH 7 (control), and incubation at 30°C until they reached OD600 0.4.
In array analysis several controls were employed to minimise technical and biological variations, and ensure the quality of the data, i.e. i) each ORF was present in duplicate in each array, ii) each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two-separate arrays with reversal of incorporated dye and iii) three independent RNA batches from each condition were analysed. Only differences of ≥ 2 fold change in the levels of gene expression, which also had P values of 0.05, were recorded as significant.
