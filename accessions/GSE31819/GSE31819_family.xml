    <Data-Processing>
Dual-channel array images were analyzed with ArrayPro 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). Spots were screened visually to identify those of low quality. Slide data were processed with MicroPreP. Prior to analysis, automatically and manually flagged spots and spots with very low background subtracted signal intensity (5% of the weakest spots [sum of Cy3 and Cy5 net signals]) were filtered out of all data sets.Net signal intensities were calculated by grid-based background subtraction. A grid-based Lowess transformation was performed for slide normalization, negative and empty values were removed, and outliers were removed by the deviation test. Expression ratios of copY mutant strain over the D39 wild-type strain were calculated. Further analysis was performed with a Cyber-T Student t test for paired data.

    <Data-Processing>
Dual-channel array images were analyzed with ArrayPro 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). Spots were screened visually to identify those of low quality. Slide data were processed with MicroPreP. Prior to analysis, automatically and manually flagged spots and spots with very low background subtracted signal intensity (5% of the weakest spots [sum of Cy3 and Cy5 net signals]) were filtered out of all data sets.Net signal intensities were calculated by grid-based background subtraction. A grid-based Lowess transformation was performed for slide normalization, negative and empty values were removed, and outliers were removed by the deviation test. Expression ratios of copY mutant strain over the D39 wild-type strain were calculated. Further analysis was performed with a Cyber-T Student t test for paired data.

RNA was isolated and purified using the High Pure RNA isolation kit (Roche diagnostics) as described (Kloosterman et al., 2006). Contaminating genomic DNA was removed by treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Roche diagnostics). RNA was isolated from Four replicate cultures.

Total RNA was incubated for 16 h at 42°C in the presence of 400 U Superscript III RNase H reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 0.2 mM aminoallyl dUTP (Amersham), 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP, and 3.2 g random nonamers. The synthesized cDNA was then labeled by coupling either Cy3 or Cy5 to the dUTP aminoallyl reactive group (CyScribe postlabeling kit; Amersham Biosciences) and was purified using a GFX PCR, DNA, and gel band purification kit (Amersham Biosciences

Sample 1
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Dual-channel array images were analyzed with ArrayPro 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). Spots were screened visually to identify those of low quality. Slide data were processed with MicroPreP. Prior to analysis, automatically and manually flagged spots and spots with very low background subtracted signal intensity (5% of the weakest spots [sum of Cy3 and Cy5 net signals]) were filtered out of all data sets.Net signal intensities were calculated by grid-based background subtraction. A grid-based Lowess transformation was performed for slide normalization, negative and empty values were removed, and outliers were removed by the deviation test. Expression ratios of copY mutant strain over the D39 wild-type strain were calculated. Further analysis was performed with a Cyber-T Student t test for paired data.
