The LSUHSC-S_Shelver_GBS_5K_V1.0 was designed according to standard Affymetrix GeneChip protocols.  The array covers the ORFs of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) strain COH1 and 24 PM/MM 25-mer probes were utilized for each ORF.  Probe selection was conducted by Affymetrix.  Each chip contains two copies of each probe.  The chip was manufactured by Nimblegen for Affymetrix via the Affymetrix NimbleExpress program.

Group B Streptococcus (GBS) strains were cultured in chemically defined medium (CDM) with 400ug/ml Met to an O.D.600 = 0.3.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
50 ml of cells (O.D.600 = 0.3) were harvested by centrifugation. GBS cells were then placed in a 950 ul suspension of QBio lysing matrix B, 50mM sodium acetate pH 4.0, 0.5% SDS, and 25% acidic phenol (Amresco; Solon, OH).  Cells were mechanically disrupted with the lysing matrix using a FastPrepÂ® 120 device (MP Biomedicals; Solon, OH) with a speed setting of 5 and pulse length of 22 s.  The mixture was separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes.  RNA was precipitated by adding sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to a final concentration of 0.3M and adding 2 volumes of 100% ethanol.  One ml of Trizol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.  200 ul of chloroform was added, shaken vigorously, and allowed to remain at room temperature for 2 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged for ten minutes, the aqueous phase was recovered and RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of 100% isopropanol.  The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 50 ul DEPC-treated water.  Residual DNA was removed using DNaseI (Promega) and subsequent clean-up with a RNEasy mini spin column (Qiagen).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA was synthesized from 10 ug of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).  Carryover RNA was degraded with 1 N NaOH followed by 1 N HCl.  cDNA was purified and concentrated using a MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen).  Samples were fragmented with DNase I (Promega; Madison, WI) and biotin end-labelled with GeneChip DNA Labeling Reagent (Affymetrix)
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A hybridization cocktail containing 3.9 ug labelled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays.  Hybridization was performed for 16 hours with a rotation of 60 rpm at a temperature of 45oC in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix).  Arrays were washed and stained with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate using predefined protocols with a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (protocol ProkGE-WS2_450).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Arrays were scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 300 7G (Affymetrix). 
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 3.
Scanned microarray images were analyzed using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) 1.4 (Affymetrix).  The absolute call (present, marginal, absent) of each gene expression in each sample, as well as the direction of change, and fold change of gene expressions between samples were identified using the above-mentioned software.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Expression signals were calculated using the MAS5 statistical algorithm with the Affymetrix GCOS software version 1.4. Signal values were globally scaled to an intensity value of 500.

      <Extract-Protocol>
50 ml of cells (O.D.600 = 0.3) were harvested by centrifugation. GBS cells were then placed in a 950 ul suspension of QBio lysing matrix B, 50mM sodium acetate pH 4.0, 0.5% SDS, and 25% acidic phenol (Amresco; Solon, OH).  Cells were mechanically disrupted with the lysing matrix using a FastPrepÂ® 120 device (MP Biomedicals; Solon, OH) with a speed setting of 5 and pulse length of 22 s.  The mixture was separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes.  RNA was precipitated by adding sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to a final concentration of 0.3M and adding 2 volumes of 100% ethanol.  One ml of Trizol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min.  200 ul of chloroform was added, shaken vigorously, and allowed to remain at room temperature for 2 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged for ten minutes, the aqueous phase was recovered and RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of 100% isopropanol.  The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 50 ul DEPC-treated water.  Residual DNA was removed using DNaseI (Promega) and subsequent clean-up with a RNEasy mini spin column (Qiagen).

    <Title>Streptococcus agalactiae genes controlled by the MtaR transcription factor</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE13325</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19087320</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The purpose of this study was to determine what S. agalactiae genes are under the control of the MtaR regulatory protein.  Inactivation of the Streptococcus agalactiae mtaR gene resulted in the downregulation of 11 genes and the upregulation of 1 gene in the mtaR mutant.  Genes involved in the uptake of methionine and a gene involved in the degradation of peptides were downregulated. Also, genes involved in the transport and biosynthesis of arginine were downregulated.  The gene encoding the virulence factor cspA was downregulated, as well as a gene showing similarity to plasminogen activators.  Thus, the expression of genes involved in both metabolic functions and virulence are under the influence of mtaR.    
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Three cultures of an mtaR insertional mutant (DS101) and three cultures of the isogenic wild-type strain (COH1) were grown in a chemically-defined medium.  Cells were disrupted with glass-bead and RNA was isolated by a Trizol method.  A custom Affymetrix chip was utilized for microarray analysis.  Genes were considered differentially-expressed if they showed a &gt;2.0-fold difference in expression between the strains and a Bayesian (Cyber-T) t-test value of &lt;0.001.  The posterior probability of differential expression (PPDE) (&lt; p) value for the genes identified was &gt;0.964.
