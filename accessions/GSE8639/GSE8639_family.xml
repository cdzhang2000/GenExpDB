Frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (GIBCOy BRL) and transferred to 2-ml screw-cap tubes containing 0.4-ml of 0.1-mm diameter zirconiaysilica beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK).

H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette–Gue´rin (BCG) Montreal (ATCC 35735) were maintained on Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) with 0.05% Tween 80 and ADC supplement or on Middlebrook 7H10 plates at 37 C. Bacilli were grown in roller bottles unless otherwise noted. When needed, kanamycin was used at 30 ug/ml and hygromycin at 50 ug/ml. Defined hypoxic culture was as previously described. Gas flow was maintained at  aproximatly at 0.15 standard cubic feet (4.2 liters) per hour within each flask.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

      <Label-Protocol>
All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described (PMID: 10536008 and 11398407). Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step. The quality of cDNA labeling was monitored by quantitatively measuring the intensities of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the MTB genomic positive control spots.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 6. Control, strain H37Rv. Cell culture grew in 20% oxygen.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described (PMID: 10536008 and 11398407). Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step. The quality of cDNA labeling was monitored by quantitatively measuring the intensities of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled samples hybridized to the MTB genomic positive control spots.

Biological replicate 3 of 6. Control, strain H37Rv. Cell culture grew in 20% oxygen.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

    <Title>Regulation of the Mycobacterium tuberculosishypoxic response gene encoding alpha-crystallin</Title>

    <Summary>
Unlike many pathogens that are overtly toxic to their hosts, the primary virulence determinant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis appears to be its ability to persist for years or decades within humans in a clinically latent state. Since early in the 20th century latency has been linked to hypoxic conditions within the host, but the response of M. tuberculosis to a hypoxic signal remains poorly characterized. The M. tuberculosis alpha-crystallin (acr) gene is powerfully and rapidly induced at reduced oxygen tensions, providing us with a means to identify regulators of the hypoxic response. Using a whole genome microarray, we identified &gt;100 genes whose expression is rapidly altered by defined hypoxic conditions. Numerous genes involved in biosynthesis and aerobic metabolism are repressed, whereas a high proportion of the induced genes have no known function. Among the induced genes is an apparent operon that includes the putative two-component response regulator pair Rv3133cy Rv3132c. When we interrupted expression of this operon by targeted disruption of the upstream gene Rv3134c, the hypoxic regulation of acr was eliminated. These results suggest a possible role for Rv3132cy3133cy3134c in mycobacterial latency.
