      <Extract-Protocol>
For extraction of the total RNA Biofilm-grown S. mutans cells were suspended in TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and dislodged by scraping into a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0•4 ml 1-mm-diameter glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cells were disrupted with the aid of a Fast Prep Cell Disrupter (Bio 101, Savant Instruments, Inc., NY, USA), centrifuged and the RNA containing supernatant was supplemented with 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane (BCP) (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA). The upper aqueous phase was precipitated with isopropanol. After centrifugation, the resulting RNA pellet was washed with ethanol and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. Because of the sensitivity of the PCR, residual contaminating DNA was eliminated by incubation of the sample with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The DNase was then inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 10 minutes, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. The RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the Nanodrop Instrument (ND-1000, Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The integrity of the RNA was assessed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. The same procedure was conducted for RNA extraction from planktonic cells, which were collected after centrifugation (4,500 g, 4 ºC) and immediately resuspended in TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA).

      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA was generated with random hexamers (6 µg) from 2 µg total RNA using the superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C overnight with aminoallyl labeled dUTP. Removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free amines was carried out using Microcon YM-30 (Millipore) filters according to manufacturer recommendations. Coupling of aminoallyl-labelled cDNA to Cy-dye esters was preformed in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 8.6 for 1hr at room temperature. Removal of free dyes was accomplished with QIAquick PCR purification columns (QIAGEN). The labeling level was the quantified using a spectrophotometer ND-100 (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Each Cy3-labeled sample was mixed with equal amount of Cy5-labeled sample, and the mixtures were allowed to dry in a speed vacuum for about 1 hour.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The samples were resuspended in hybridization buffer containing: 50 % formamide, 5 x SSC, 0.1 % SDS and 20 µg yeast tRNA, and heated at 90 °C for 10 min. following a quick centrifugation, the Cy dye-coupled probes were applied to microarray slides and incubated over-night at 42 °C. The hybridization was carried out in corning hybridization chambers submerged in a water bath. 
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The hybridization patterns and intensities were quantitatively analyzed using the GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon) on scanned microarray images. This software localizes every spot with a programmed grid to obtain an averaged signal density of each spot and background (offset) of the area surrounding the spot.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
The hybridized slides were then washed and scanned by using Axon GenePix 4000B Scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) with adjusted settings in order to obtain a similar green and red overall intensity.  The results represent the common findings of three independent biological replicate arrays performed with three different RNA samples. In two of the arrays the biofilm RNA sample was labeled with Cy5 and the planktonic with Cy3, while the third array was dye swapped. The hybridization patterns and intensities were quantitatively analyzed using the GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon) on scanned microarray images. This software localizes every spot with a programmed grid to obtain an averaged signal density of each spot and background (offset) of the area surrounding the spot.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The result files (gpr) produced by GenePix have been imported into R and analyzed utilizing LIMMA (Smyth, 2004) software package for R, available from CRAN site (http://www.r-project.org). Spots flagged as not found or absent in GenePix were removed by filtering. Another filter was applied for saturated spots. After filtering, the data within the same slide was normalized using global loess normalization with the default smoothing span of 0.3 (Smyth &amp; Speed, 2003) To identify differentially expressed genes a parametric empirical Bayesian approach implemented in LIMMA (Lonnstedt &amp; Speed, 2002) was used. A moderated t test was performed in parallel, with the use of a false discovery rate (Reiner et al., 2003) correction for multiple testing. TIGR arrays include four replicates for each gene. Instead of just taking the average of replicate spots, we used the duplicate Correlation function (Smyth et al., 2005) available in LIMMA to acquire an approximation of gene-by-gene variance. This method greatly improves the precision with which the gene-wise variances are estimated and thereby maximize inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. P &lt;0.05 confidence level has been used to pinpoint those significantly differentiated genes. Genes had to have an A-value (average expression level for the gene across all arrays and channels) of more than 7.5, leaving out genes with an average intensity in both channels less than 200.

For extraction of the total RNA Biofilm-grown S. mutans cells were suspended in TRI Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and dislodged by scraping into a 2-ml microcentrifuge tube containing 0.4 ml 1-mm-diameter glass beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). The cells were disrupted with the aid of a Fast Prep Cell Disrupter (Bio 101, Savant Instruments, Inc., NY, USA), centrifuged and the RNA containing supernatant was supplemented with 1-Bromo-3-Chloropropane (BCP) (Molecular Research Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA). The upper aqueous phase was precipitated with isopropanol. After centrifugation, the resulting RNA pellet was washed with ethanol and resuspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. Because of the sensitivity of the PCR, residual contaminating DNA was eliminated by incubation of the sample with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). The DNase was then inactivated by incubation at 65 °C for 10 minutes, and the RNA was precipitated with ethanol and suspended in diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. The RNA concentration was determined spectrophotometrically using the Nanodrop Instrument (ND-1000, Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). The integrity of the RNA was assessed by agarose-gel electrophoresis.

      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA was generated with random hexamers (6 µg) from 2 µg total RNA using the superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, USA). The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42 °C overnight with aminoallyl labeled dUTP. Removal of unincorporated aa-dUTP and free amines was carried out using Microcon YM-30 (Millipore) filters according to manufacturer recommendations. Coupling of aminoallyl-labelled cDNA to Cy-dye esters was preformed in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer pH 8.6 for 1hr at room temperature. Removal of free dyes was accomplished with QIAquick PCR purification columns (QIAGEN). The labeling level was the quantified using a spectrophotometer ND-100 (Nanodrop Technologies, Wilmington, DE, USA). Each Cy3-labeled sample was mixed with equal amount of Cy5-labeled sample, and the mixtures were allowed to dry in a speed vacuum for about 1 hour.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization was performed basically according to TIGR protocol (http://pfgrc.tigr.org/protocols/M008.pdf). The samples were resuspended in hybridization buffer containing: 50 % formamide, 5 x SSC, 0.1 % SDS and 20 µg yeast tRNA, and heated at 90 °C for 10 min. following a quick centrifugation, the Cy dye-coupled probes were applied to microarray slides and incubated over-night at 42 °C. The hybridization was carried out in corning hybridization chambers submerged in a water bath. 
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The hybridized slides were then washed and scanned by using Axon GenePix 4000B Scanner (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA) with adjusted settings in order to obtain a similar green and red overall intensity. The hybridization patterns and intensities were quantitatively analyzed using the GenePix Pro 4.0 software (Axon) on scanned microarray images. This software localizes every spot with a programmed grid to obtain an averaged signal density of each spot and background (offset) of the area surrounding the spot.

S. mutans UA159 was grown in Brain Heart Infusion Broth (BHI, Difco Labs, Detroit, USA) at 37 ºC in 95 % air/5 % CO2 (v/v). Culture of S. mutans was diluted 1:50, inoculated into fresh BHI media and grown in polystyrene tubes (37 ºC, 5 95 % air/5 % CO2 (v/v)). For biofilm generation, 20 μl of S. mutans culture grown as described above was seeded in 20-mm-diameter, 15-mm-deep sterile polystyrene multidishes.

    <Data-Processing>
The result files (gpr) produced by GenePix have been imported into R and analyzed utilizing LIMMA (Smyth, 2004) software package for R, available from CRAN site (http://www.r-project.org). Spots flagged as not found or absent in GenePix were removed by filtering. Another filter was applied for saturated spots. After filtering, the data within the same slide was normalized using global loess normalization with the default smoothing span of 0.3 (Smyth &amp; Speed, 2003) To identify differentially expressed genes a parametric empirical Bayesian approach implemented in LIMMA (Lonnstedt &amp; Speed, 2002) was used. A moderated t test was performed in parallel, with the use of a false discovery rate (Reiner et al., 2003) correction for multiple testing. TIGR arrays include four replicates for each gene. Instead of just taking the average of replicate spots, we used the duplicate Correlation function (Smyth et al., 2005) available in LIMMA to acquire an approximation of gene-by-gene variance. This method greatly improves the precision with which the gene-wise variances are estimated and thereby maximize inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. P &lt;0.05 confidence level has been used to pinpoint those significantly differentiated genes. Genes had to have an A-value (average expression level for the gene across all arrays and channels) of more than 7.5, leaving out genes with an average intensity in both channels less than 200.

    <Summary>
In vitro comparative transcriptome analysis was carried to determine genes that are differentially expressed in S. mutans biofilm compared with free-living cells. DNA-microarray analyses indicated that about 12 % of genes showed significant differential expression: 139 were activated and 104 were repressed in biofilm vs. planktonic environment.
