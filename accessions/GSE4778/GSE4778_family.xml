    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

E. coli K-12 strain W3110 was diluted 500- fold in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at pH 7.6.  The cultures were rotated at 225 rpm at 37ÂºC.  Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2.  External pH was lowered to 5.5 with 1 M HCl.  Four samples were taken from each of five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

    <Description>
Gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 were compared as a function of time versus change in external pH. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:500 in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at 7.6. Bacteria were cultured in baffled flasks (less than 10% volume) with rotation at 225 rpm, incubated at 37Â°C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2. External pH was lowered to pH 5.5 by adding 840 Âµl of 1M HCl to 40 mls of culture within 5 seconds. Four samples were taken from each of  five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

E. coli K-12 strain W3110 was diluted 500- fold in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at pH 7.6.  The cultures were rotated at 225 rpm at 37ÂºC.  Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2.  External pH was lowered to 5.5 with 1 M HCl.  Four samples were taken from each of five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

    <Description>
Gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 were compared as a function of time versus change in external pH. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:500 in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at 7.6. Bacteria were cultured in baffled flasks (less than 10% volume) with rotation at 225 rpm, incubated at 37Â°C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2. External pH was lowered to pH 5.5 by adding 840 Âµl of 1M HCl to 40 mls of culture within 5 seconds. Four samples were taken from each of  five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

      <Growth-Protocol>
E. coli K-12 strain W3110 was diluted 500- fold in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at pH 7.6.  The cultures were rotated at 225 rpm at 37ÂºC.  Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2.  External pH was lowered to 5.5 with 1 M HCl.  Four samples were taken from each of five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

    <Description>
Gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 were compared as a function of time versus change in external pH. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:500 in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at 7.6. Bacteria were cultured in baffled flasks (less than 10% volume) with rotation at 225 rpm, incubated at 37Â°C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2. External pH was lowered to pH 5.5 by adding 840 Âµl of 1M HCl to 40 mls of culture within 5 seconds. Four samples were taken from each of  five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

E. coli K-12 strain W3110 was diluted 500- fold in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at pH 7.6.  The cultures were rotated at 225 rpm at 37ÂºC.  Cultures were grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2.  External pH was lowered to 5.5 with 1 M HCl.  Four samples were taken from each of five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

    <Description>
Gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 were compared as a function of time versus change in external pH. Overnight cultures were diluted 1:500 in potassium-modified Luria-Bertani medium (LBK) buffered with 20 mM HOMOPIPES at 7.6. Bacteria were cultured in baffled flasks (less than 10% volume) with rotation at 225 rpm, incubated at 37Â°C to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.2. External pH was lowered to pH 5.5 by adding 840 Âµl of 1M HCl to 40 mls of culture within 5 seconds. Four samples were taken from each of  five replicate cultures, corresponding to time 0 (before HCl addition),1, 5, and 10 min post HCl addition.

    <Title>Acid-Shifted Time Course of Gene Expression Profiles of Aerobically Grown Escherichia coli K-12</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>18302792</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The effect of an extracellular acid shift on gene expression profiles of Escherichia coli K-12 W3110 was observed using Affymetrix E. coli arrays. In order to maximize aeration and maintain logarithmic growth, the overnight culture (LBK broth medium) was diluted 500-fold into a 250-ml baffled flask containing 55 ml of 20mM HOMOPIPES buffered medium (pH 7.6). Cultures were grown to OD600=0.2. A shift to acid external pH was conducted by rapid addition of 840 Âµl 1M HCl, which lowered the pH of the medium to pH 5.5. For each of five biological replicates, 10-ml samples were taken at times 0, 1, 5, and 10 min post addition of HCl. Each sample was added to 1 ml 10% phenol-ethanol stop solution in &lt;5 sec. For each sample, cDNA synthesized from total RNA was hybridized onto Affymetrix E. coli arrays. Model-based gene expression intensities were determined using GCOS software. Gene-by-gene temporal differential expression was analyzed as a mixed-effects model using polynomial time functions as fixed effects and flask variation as a random effect.
