RNA was isolated from samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Prior to lysis all samples were incubated for 30 min on ice in RNA stop solution (0.1% SDS, 1% Acidic phenol, 19% ethanol, ice cold). The lysis and digestion protocol was followed with two 50 μl ddH20 elutions. Each sample was treated with 2 μl of DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were purified and concentrated using Microcon YM-30 columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the quantity and purity were determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). Samples were determined to be free of contaminating genomic DNA by absence of a band on a DNA electrophoresis gel after 30 rounds of PCR.

Targets were generated from 10 µg of DNase treated total RNA as follows. Ten µg of total RNA was combined with 1 μl of 10 µg/μl random hexamers (Integrated DNA Technologies) and ddH20 was added to bring the total reaction volume to 15.5 μl. Samples were incubated at 70°C for 10 min followed by 10 min incubation on ice. After incubation, 14.5 μl of a reaction mix (6 μl of 5x First Strand Buffer, 1.2 μl of 25x aa-dUTP/dNTP mix (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD), 3 μl 0.1M DTT, 2 μl Superscript III 200U/ μl (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), 2.4 μl RNase-free water) was added and reactions were incubated at 42°C for at least 2 hrs. After incubation, RNA was immediately hydrolyzed by incubation with 3 μl 0.1 M ETDA and 3.5 μl 0.1 M NaOH at 65°C for 10 min. The pH was neutralized with the addition of 36.5 μl of 500 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). Reactions were purified using the Mo Bio UltraClean PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), quantified using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer, dried-down, and resuspended in 10 μl RNase-free water and 1.5 μl sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.7). After 10 min, 6 μl of Cy 3 (catalog number PA25001) or Cy 5 (catalog number PA23001) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) were added according the microarray experimental design, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Dyes were prepared by resuspending a single tube of dye in 72 μl of DMSO and storing in 6 μl aliquots at -70°C until use. Dye coupled reactions were purified in the same manner as cDNA synthesis reactions. Frequency of dye incorporation and yield was determined using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer.

Targets were generated from 10 µg of DNase treated total RNA as follows. Ten µg of total RNA was combined with 1 μl of 10 µg/μl random hexamers (Integrated DNA Technologies) and ddH20 was added to bring the total reaction volume to 15.5 μl. Samples were incubated at 70°C for 10 min followed by 10 min incubation on ice. After incubation, 14.5 μl of a reaction mix (6 μl of 5x First Strand Buffer, 1.2 μl of 25x aa-dUTP/dNTP mix (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD), 3 μl 0.1M DTT, 2 μl Superscript III 200U/ μl (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), 2.4 μl RNase-free water) was added and reactions were incubated at 42°C for at least 2 hrs. After incubation, RNA was immediately hydrolyzed by incubation with 3 μl 0.1 M ETDA and 3.5 μl 0.1 M NaOH at 65°C for 10 min. The pH was neutralized with the addition of 36.5 μl of 500 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). Reactions were purified using the Mo Bio UltraClean PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), quantified using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer, dried-down, and resuspended in 10 μl RNase-free water and 1.5 μl sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.7). After 10 min, 6 μl of Cy 3 (catalog number PA25001) or Cy 5 (catalog number PA23001) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) were added according the microarray experimental design, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Dyes were prepared by resuspending a single tube of dye in 72 μl of DMSO and storing in 6 μl aliquots at -70°C until use. Dye coupled reactions were purified in the same manner as cDNA synthesis reactions. Frequency of dye incorporation and yield was determined using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer.

RNA was isolated from samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Prior to lysis all samples were incubated for 30 min on ice in RNA stop solution (0.1% SDS, 1% Acidic phenol, 19% ethanol, ice cold). The lysis and digestion protocol was followed with two 50 μl ddH20 elutions. Each sample was treated with 2 μl of DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were purified and concentrated using Microcon YM-30 columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the quantity and purity were determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). Samples were determined to be free of contaminating genomic DNA by absence of a band on a DNA electrophoresis gel after 30 rounds of PCR.

RNA was isolated from samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Prior to lysis all samples were incubated for 30 min on ice in RNA stop solution (0.1% SDS, 1% Acidic phenol, 19% ethanol, ice cold). The lysis and digestion protocol was followed with two 50 μl ddH20 elutions. Each sample was treated with 2 μl of DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were purified and concentrated using Microcon YM-30 columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the quantity and purity were determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). Samples were determined to be free of contaminating genomic DNA by absence of a band on a DNA electrophoresis gel after 30 rounds of PCR.

Targets were generated from 10 µg of DNase treated total RNA as follows. Ten µg of total RNA was combined with 1 μl of 10 µg/μl random hexamers (Integrated DNA Technologies) and ddH20 was added to bring the total reaction volume to 15.5 μl. Samples were incubated at 70°C for 10 min followed by 10 min incubation on ice. After incubation, 14.5 μl of a reaction mix (6 μl of 5x First Strand Buffer, 1.2 μl of 25x aa-dUTP/dNTP mix (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD), 3 μl 0.1M DTT, 2 μl Superscript III 200U/ μl (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), 2.4 μl RNase-free water) was added and reactions were incubated at 42°C for at least 2 hrs. After incubation, RNA was immediately hydrolyzed by incubation with 3 μl 0.1 M ETDA and 3.5 μl 0.1 M NaOH at 65°C for 10 min. The pH was neutralized with the addition of 36.5 μl of 500 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). Reactions were purified using the Mo Bio UltraClean PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), quantified using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer, dried-down, and resuspended in 10 μl RNase-free water and 1.5 μl sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.7). After 10 min, 6 μl of Cy 3 (catalog number PA25001) or Cy 5 (catalog number PA23001) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) were added according the microarray experimental design, and samples were incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Dyes were prepared by resuspending a single tube of dye in 72 μl of DMSO and storing in 6 μl aliquots at -70°C until use. Dye coupled reactions were purified in the same manner as cDNA synthesis reactions. Frequency of dye incorporation and yield was determined using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer.

To better understand the impact of intracellular carriage of E. coli O157:H7 within a ruminant protozoa, global transcript levels of strain EDL933 cells grown under within Acanthamoeba were compared to cells grown in ATCC PYG712 using microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Mixed model analysis was conducted as previously described (Madsen, et al., 2006) excluding slide region and slide-by-region interaction effects. The value column was not used for analysis or in publication. The normalized values for duplicate spots were averaged within each array to produce one normalized measure of expression for each of the probe sequences and each of the RNA samples.

RNA was isolated from samples using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). Prior to lysis all samples were incubated for 30 min on ice in RNA stop solution (0.1% SDS, 1% Acidic phenol, 19% ethanol, ice cold). The lysis and digestion protocol was followed with two 50 μl ddH20 elutions. Each sample was treated with 2 μl of DNase (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 37°C for 30 min. Samples were purified and concentrated using Microcon YM-30 columns (Millipore, Billerica, MA), and the quantity and purity were determined using an ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE). Samples were determined to be free of contaminating genomic DNA by absence of a band on a DNA electrophoresis gel after 30 rounds of PCR.

Targets were generated from 10 µg of DNase treated total RNA as follows. Ten µg of total RNA was combined with 1 μl of 10 µg/μl random hexamers (Integrated DNA Technologies) and ddH20 was added to bring the total reaction volume to 15.5 μl. Samples were incubated at 70°C for 10 min followed by 10 min incubation on ice. After incubation, 14.5 μl of a reaction mix (6 μl of 5x First Strand Buffer, 1.2 μl of 25x aa-dUTP/dNTP mix (Fermentas, Glen Burnie, MD), 3 μl 0.1M DTT, 2 μl Superscript III 200U/ μl (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA), 2.4 μl RNase-free water) was added and reactions were incubated at 42°C for at least 2 hrs. After incubation, RNA was immediately hydrolyzed by incubation with 3 μl 0.1 M ETDA and 3.5 μl 0.1 M NaOH at 65°C for 10 min. The pH was neutralized with the addition of 36.5 μl of 500 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). Reactions were purified using the Mo Bio UltraClean PCR Clean-Up Kit (MO BIO Laboratories, Inc., Carlsbad, CA), quantified using the ND-1000 spectrophotometer, dried-down, and resuspended in 10 μl RNase-free water and 1.5 μl sodium bicarbonate (pH 8.7).

    <Summary>
The transcriptome of Escherichia coli K-12 has been widely studied over a variety of conditions for the past decade while such studies involving E. coli O157:H7, its pathogenic cousin, are just now being conducted. To better understand the impact of intracellular life within a ruminant and environmental protozoan on E. coli O157:H7, global transcript levels of strain EDL933 cells inside Acanthamoeba were compared to cell grown in the protozoan media (ATCC PYG712) by microarray.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Nine independent RNA samples from cell from within Acanthamoeba were paired with seven independent RNA samples from control cultures for hybridization to nine two-color microarrays. For four arrays, the control RNA sample was labeled with Cy3 dye and the experimental RNA sample was labeled with Cy5 dye, the dyes were reversed for the other five arrays to overcome dye bias.
