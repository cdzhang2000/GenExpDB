    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package.  Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method.  The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors.  The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error.  Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.  The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package.  Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method.  The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors.  The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error.  Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.  The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package.  Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method.  The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors.  The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error.  Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.  The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package.  Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method.  The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors.  The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error.  Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.  The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package.  Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method.  The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors.  The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error.  Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.  The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package.  Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method.  The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors.  The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error.  Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.  The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC.

There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package.  Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method.  The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors.  The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error.  Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.  The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

    <Title>Identification of genes regulated by gadE in E. coli O157:H7</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE13132</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19114477</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Integrating laterally acquired virulence genes into the backbone regulatory network is important for the pathogenesis of Escherichia coli O157:H7, which has captured many virulence genes through horizontal transfer during evolution. GadE is an essential transcriptional activator of glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) system, the most efficient acid resistance mechanism in E. coli. The full contribution of GadE to the acid resistance and virulence of pathogenic E. coli O157:H7 remains largely unknown. We inactivated gadE in E. coli O157:H7 Sakai and compared global transcription profiles with that of wild type in exponential and stationary phases of growth using microarrays containing 6088 ORFs from three E. coli genomes. gadE inactivation significantly altered the expression of 60 genes independent of growth phase and 122 genes in a growth phase-dependent manner. Inactivation of gadE markedly down-regulated the expression of gadA, gadB, gadC and many acid fitness island genes in a growth phase-dependent manner. Nineteen genes encoded on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), including ler, showed a significant increase in expression upon gadE inactivation. Altogether, our data indicate that GadE is critical for acid resistance of E. coli O157:H7 and plays an important role in virulence by down-regulating expression of LEE.   
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The results are based on O157:H7 Sakai wild type and gadE mutant exponential and stationary phase cultures grown in MOPS minimal medium. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), strain (wild type or mutant) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+strain+phase*strain. We incorporated the dye-swaps among the biological replicates.
