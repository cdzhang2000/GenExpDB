Oligonucleotide probes were prepared for all the protein-coding genes on the O157 Sakai genome (5,447 genes in total).  Principles for the probe design were 60-mer in length and one probe per gene/CDS.  For each gene, we designed 60-mer probe except one 44 or 45-mer probes for 7 genes.  In total, 5447 probes were synthesized (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan), and each probe was spotted onto poly-L-Lysine coated glass slides (SD10011; Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) using SPBIO (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan).

    <Data-Processing>
The signal density of each spot was quantified using IMAGENE software (BioDiscovery). We first corrected the intensity of each spot by subtracting the local background. The mean values of the negative control spots containing yeast oligo DNA and the spots containing spotting buffer alone were determined, with the standard deviation (SD).

Fluorescent-labeled cDNA probes were synthesized in a reverse-transcriptase reaction with AMVXL (XL Life Science) and Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia) and the mixture of specific primers made from the total EHEC RNA. The specific primer was a 16-mer oligo DNA that was anti-sense to the downstream sequence of the spotted oligo DNA for each gene. Labeled cDNA probes were purified by Centri-sep (Princeton Separations), phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation.

Fluorescent-labeled cDNA probes were synthesized in a reverse-transcriptase reaction with AMVXL (XL Life Science) and Cy3-dUTP or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Pharmacia) and the mixture of specific primers made from the total EHEC RNA. The specific primer was a 16-mer oligo DNA that was anti-sense to the downstream sequence of the spotted oligo DNA for each gene. Labeled cDNA probes were purified by Centri-sep (Princeton Separations), phenol-chloroform extraction, and ethanol precipitation.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The labeled cDNA probes were then dissolved in water, mixed with hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA), and heat-denatured. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 16 h. Slides were washed with 2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 50 °C twice, then with 0.2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 20 °C twice.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The slides were scanned for fluorescence intensity using a GMS 418 array scanner (Genetic Microsystems), and the information was converted to 16-bit image files.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The signal density of each spot was quantified using IMAGENE software (BioDiscovery). We first corrected the intensity of each spot by subtracting the local background. The mean values of the negative control spots containing yeast oligo DNA and the spots containing spotting buffer alone were determined, with the standard deviation (SD).

The labeled cDNA probes were then dissolved in water, mixed with hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA), and heat-denatured. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 16 h. Slides were washed with 2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 50 °C twice, then with 0.2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 20 °C twice.

    <Data-Processing>
The signal density of each spot was quantified using IMAGENE software (BioDiscovery). We first corrected the intensity of each spot by subtracting the local background. The mean values of the negative control spots containing yeast oligo DNA and the spots containing spotting buffer alone were determined, with the standard deviation (SD).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The labeled cDNA probes were then dissolved in water, mixed with hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA), and heat-denatured. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 16 h. Slides were washed with 2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 50 °C twice, then with 0.2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 20 °C twice.

    <Scan-Protocol>
The slides were scanned for fluorescence intensity using a GMS 418 array scanner (Genetic Microsystems), and the information was converted to 16-bit image files.

    <Data-Processing>
The signal density of each spot was quantified using IMAGENE software (BioDiscovery). We first corrected the intensity of each spot by subtracting the local background. The mean values of the negative control spots containing yeast oligo DNA and the spots containing spotting buffer alone were determined, with the standard deviation (SD).

    <Summary>
Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an emerging pathogen that causes diarrhea and heamolytic uremic syndrome. Much of the genomic information that affects virulence is acquired via horizontal transfer. Genes necessary for attaching and effacing lesions are located in the LEE pathogenicity island. LEE gene transcription is positively regulated by Ler, which is also encoded by the LEE, and by Pch regulators, which are encoded at other loci. We identified genes whose transcription profiles were similar to those of the LEE genes, by comparing the effects of altering ler and pch transcript levels. We assigned these genes into two classes, according to their transcription profiles.
Keywords: Genetic modification
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
13 sets of comparison between transcription profiles in strains with different pch or ler genotypes. Labelling of cDNA and hybridization were performed twice with independently prepared RNAs.
