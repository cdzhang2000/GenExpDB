Microarray capture probes were obtained as a collection of  “Array-Ready” 70mer DNA oligonucleotides at 600 pmol each comprising 4,325 M. tuberculosis-specific sequences and 25 controls (Operon Biotechnologies). The major portion of M. tuberculosis-specific oligonucleotides was designed from 3,924 predicted protein coding sequences of M. tuberculosis H37Rv (Sanger Center). A smaller portion was designed from the strain CDC-1551, sequenced and predicted by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR). At least 371 predicted genes from CDC-1551 were found to have less than 97% homology to M. tuberculosis H37Rv predicted genes, and therefore these sequences were included in the M. tuberculosis probe set. The oligonucleotides were suspended at a final concentration of 100 µM in Nexterion spot2 buffer (Schott) and printed by a BioRobotics MicroGrid II robot (Genomic Solutions) onto glass slides coated with poly-L-lysine at 50–55% humidity and room temperature using MicroSpot 2500 quill pins (Genomic Solutions). Oligonucleotides were cross-linked to the support by UV irradiation with a total energy of 240 mJ UV and blocked with succinic anhydride and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone in borate buffer (Fluka).

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

M. tuberculosis H37Ra ATCC 25177 was used as test strain and M. tuberculosis H37Rv served as reference strain and was kindly provided by Stewart Cole (Institut Pasteur, Paris, France). Mycobacterial strain stocks were inoculated in 100ml 7H9 medium supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) albumin-dextrose-catalase enrichment (Difco Laboratories) and 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 80 (Sigma) and grown to defined time point at 37°C. Bacterial strains were cultured in roller bottles with a rolling speed of 5 rpm. For the 1-year culture sample, cultures were transferred to 50 ml tubes to the full, sealed withParafilm tightly after 2 weeks incubation in roller bottles and incubated at 37°C.

Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Fluoroscently labeled cDNAs (5 µg each) were pooled, heat denatured and mixed with hybridization buffer SlideHyb #1 (Ambion).  Hybridization was performed in a humidified hybridization chamber for 16 h submerged in a 50°C water bath with LifterSlipsTM (Erie Scientific). Slides were washed twice with the first and low stringency washing buffer (2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C, followed by 2 × of the second washing buffer (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 10 min at 50°C and the third washing buffer (0.05 × SSC) for 4 min at 25°C.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner. Images were quantified using Agilent Image Analysis / Feature Extraction software G2567AA (Version A.7.5.1) using almost default settings for microarrays loaded with a grid file, except that the constant coefficient of variation for features and background was raised 5 fold. Intensities were normalized by local background correction and by rank consistency filtering with LOWESS normalization. The log intensity ratios were calculated by using the most conservative estimate of error between Universal Error Model and propagated error.

    <Title>A PhoP point mutation discriminates between the virulent H37Rv and avirulent H37Ra strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE7539</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>18312844</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
To uncover mutations underlying the attentuation of H37Ra, we embarked on sequencing its genome using a novel massive parallel pyrosequencing technology.
Comparison with the virulent H37Rv parental strain revealed only few polymorphisms, one of which was located in the DNA binding domain of the transcriptional regulator PhoP.
Keywords: Expresion profiling
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
To investigate the phenotypic consequences caused by the mutations in the H37Ra genome, we compared the mRNA expression profiles of H37Rv and H37Ra in a protracted time course study.
