Oligonucleotides were resuspended in 384 well flat-bottom plates (Nunc, New York, USA) to a concentration of 30 μM in 3X SSC (600 pmol of oligo into a volume of 20 μl 3X SSC).  Arrays were printed on EZ-Rays aminosilane slides (Matrix Technologies, Hudson, NH, USA) with the Biorobotics Microgrid II microarray printer (Genomic Solutions, Ann Harbor, Michigan, USA). Microspot 10K quill pins (Biorobotics, Cambridge, UK) in a 48-pin tool were used to deposit 0.5 nL (0.1 ng cDNA) per spot onto the slide. The resulting microarrays have a 12 x12 subgrid layout with 144 features per subgrid, each spot having approximate diameter and pitch of 90 µm and 300µm, respectively. A 280-bp GFP (green fluorescent protein) cDNA was amplified from a GFP clone (BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA, USA) by using the primers (5’-GAAACATTCTTGGACACAAATTGG-3’) and (5’-GCAGCTGTTACAAACTCAAGAAGG -3’), and printed in subgrid corners to assist in placing on the grid. The slides were crosslinked in a UV Stratalinker 2400 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) at 300mJ. All slides are inspected manually to identify any major printing issues. One slide every 20 to 30 slides was hybridized with labeled random 9-mer oligonucleotide (SpotQC, Integrated DNA Technologies, Coraville, IA, USA) or SYBR Green 1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Ca, USA) staining and scanned using ScanArray Express scanner (Perkin Elmer, Wellesley, MA, USA). Presence/absence, shape, signal intensity vs. background, diameter and DNA binding site capability were measured for each spot on the slide using files generated by Imagene software (BioDiscovery Inc., El Secundo, CA, USA). Position and description of flagged spots (spots absent or thought to be unusable during post hybridization analysis) as well as dust, sub-grid defects and other noticed irregularities are recorded. All information collected from all slides controlled for each batch was combined into a report.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

80 pmol of the labelled cDNA were combined. The combined cDNA were speed vacuum concentrated, resuspended in 4µL 10mM EDTA and denaturated at 95°C during 1min before adding 76µL of Ambion Hybridization buffer #2 (Ambion). After 2min of denaturation at 95°C, the hybridization solution was placed on a microarray slide and covered by cover glass. The slides were assembled with hybridization chambers (Corning) and hybridized for 20h at 42°C inside a waterbath. The slides were washed 3 times in 0.5X SSC, 0.5% SDS during 5 min and then 3 times in 0.5X SSC, and were dried by centrifugation.

Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
80 pmol of the labelled cDNA were combined. The combined cDNA were speed vacuum concentrated, resuspended in 4µL 10mM EDTA and denaturated at 95°C during 1min before adding 76µL of Ambion Hybridization buffer #2 (Ambion). After 2min of denaturation at 95°C, the hybridization solution was placed on a microarray slide and covered by cover glass. The slides were assembled with hybridization chambers (Corning) and hybridized for 20h at 42°C inside a waterbath. The slides were washed 3 times in 0.5X SSC, 0.5% SDS during 5 min and then 3 times in 0.5X SSC, and were dried by centrifugation.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
80 pmol of the labelled cDNA were combined. The combined cDNA were speed vacuum concentrated, resuspended in 4µL 10mM EDTA and denaturated at 95°C during 1min before adding 76µL of Ambion Hybridization buffer #2 (Ambion). After 2min of denaturation at 95°C, the hybridization solution was placed on a microarray slide and covered by cover glass. The slides were assembled with hybridization chambers (Corning) and hybridized for 20h at 42°C inside a waterbath. The slides were washed 3 times in 0.5X SSC, 0.5% SDS during 5 min and then 3 times in 0.5X SSC, and were dried by centrifugation.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

80 pmol of the labelled cDNA were combined. The combined cDNA were speed vacuum concentrated, resuspended in 4µL 10mM EDTA and denaturated at 95°C during 1min before adding 76µL of Ambion Hybridization buffer #2 (Ambion). After 2min of denaturation at 95°C, the hybridization solution was placed on a microarray slide and covered by cover glass. The slides were assembled with hybridization chambers (Corning) and hybridized for 20h at 42°C inside a waterbath. The slides were washed 3 times in 0.5X SSC, 0.5% SDS during 5 min and then 3 times in 0.5X SSC, and were dried by centrifugation.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was extracted using Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit. DNA was removed using Ambion DNA-free kit. RNA quality was assessed using 2% agarose gels and OD260/OD280 ratio. Amino-allyl dUTP was used to label 5µg of RNA during reverse transcription. The reverse transcription was performed at 42°C during 50 min using 600 units of superscript RT II (Invitrogen), 3 µg of random hexamers, 0.6mM dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 0.2mM dTTP, and 0.4mM amino-allyl dUTP (Ambion). RNA was then degraded by incubation at 65°C, for 15 min, after adding 10µL of 0.5M EDTA and 10µL of 1M NaOH.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
80 pmol of the labelled cDNA were combined. The combined cDNA were speed vacuum concentrated, resuspended in 4µL 10mM EDTA and denaturated at 95°C during 1min before adding 76µL of Ambion Hybridization buffer #2 (Ambion). After 2min of denaturation at 95°C, the hybridization solution was placed on a microarray slide and covered by cover glass. The slides were assembled with hybridization chambers (Corning) and hybridized for 20h at 42°C inside a waterbath. The slides were washed 3 times in 0.5X SSC, 0.5% SDS during 5 min and then 3 times in 0.5X SSC, and were dried by centrifugation.

    <Scan-Protocol>
The hybridized slides were scanned with a ScanArray Express scanner (Perkin-Elmer). ImageGene v5.0 was used to quantify the spot intensities.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

Amino-allyl dUTP was used to label 5µg of RNA during reverse transcription. The reverse transcription was performed at 42°C during 50 min using 600 units of superscript RT II (Invitrogen), 3 µg of random hexamers, 0.6mM dATP, dCTP and dGTP, 0.2mM dTTP, and 0.4mM amino-allyl dUTP (Ambion). RNA was then degraded by incubation at 65°C, for 15 min, after adding 10µL of 0.5M EDTA and 10µL of 1M NaOH.

80 pmol of the labelled cDNA were combined. The combined cDNA were speed vacuum concentrated, resuspended in 4µL 10mM EDTA and denaturated at 95°C during 1min before adding 76µL of Ambion Hybridization buffer #2 (Ambion). After 2min of denaturation at 95°C, the hybridization solution was placed on a microarray slide and covered by cover glass. The slides were assembled with hybridization chambers (Corning) and hybridized for 20h at 42°C inside a waterbath. The slides were washed 3 times in 0.5X SSC, 0.5% SDS during 5 min and then 3 times in 0.5X SSC, and were dried by centrifugation.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

80 pmol of the labelled cDNA were combined. The combined cDNA were speed vacuum concentrated, resuspended in 4µL 10mM EDTA and denaturated at 95°C during 1min before adding 76µL of Ambion Hybridization buffer #2 (Ambion). After 2min of denaturation at 95°C, the hybridization solution was placed on a microarray slide and covered by cover glass. The slides were assembled with hybridization chambers (Corning) and hybridized for 20h at 42°C inside a waterbath. The slides were washed 3 times in 0.5X SSC, 0.5% SDS during 5 min and then 3 times in 0.5X SSC, and were dried by centrifugation.

    <Data-Processing>
Statistical preprocessing steps were conducted with ArrayPipe (version 1.7), a web-based software designed for processing of microarray data (www.pathogenomics.ca/arraypipe, Hokamp et al. 2004). The following pre-processing steps were applied: 1) flagging of markers and control spots, 2) subgrid-wise background correction, using the median of the lower 10% foreground intensity as an estimate for the background noise, 3) data-shifting, 4) limma’s LOESS normalization by print tip, 5) merging of duplicate spots.
VALUEs are calculated as log2-transformed (test/ref) ratios after background correction and limma's LOESS normalization

    <Pubmed-ID>18245349</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
During a 1,000 generations evolution experiment, two types of bacteria (S and L) repeatedly diverged from a common ancestor (A) in a fully sympatric seasonal environment containing glucose and acetate. We compare the transcription profile of the two derived types and the common ancestor in order to investigate the metabolic modifications associated with this adaptive diversification event.
Keywords: time point, experimental evolution
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Total RNA was extracted at 4 different time points of the 24H kinetic growth curve of each of the 3 types of bacteria (S, L and A). At each time point, S and L transcription profiles were compared to A. Each comparison was performed in 5 biological replicates.
