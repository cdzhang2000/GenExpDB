Total bacterial RNA was extracted from 3 ml of culture which was mixed with 6 ml of bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min in swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge to collect the cells. Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and the cells were broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds. From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNase treated and purified mRNA was used for microarray analysis.

cDNA was generated by using random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers for reverse transcription. The primers were annealed (70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min) to total RNA (2 μg) and were extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM dNTP/ aa-UTP (Ambion, Austin, TX) mix at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Purified labelled cDNA was hybridised with S. aureus genome microarray version 4 as previously described by Mongodin et al. (2003) and Riordon et al. (2007). Briefly, the slides were prehybridized in a buffer containing 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA, and then washed and blown to dry. The two differentially labelled cDNA samples were dried and the resuspended in hybridization solution [40% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 µg/µl sheared Salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)]. The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h. After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC) for 10 min.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Hybridization signals were scanned using an Axon4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA ) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were saved as TIFF image. 
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Genes analyzed using these programs were further sorted and grouped based on their function using our in-house software Staphylococcus aureus Gene Sorter (SAGS). 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Scans were analyzed using TIGR-Spotfinder (www.tigr.org/software/) software and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalized by applying the LOWESS algorithm using TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software/) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/reference signal for each spot was recorded. Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded. The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html software using one class mode.

From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNase treated and purified mRNA was used for microarray analysis.

cDNA was generated by using random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers for reverse transcription. The primers were annealed (70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min) to total RNA (2 μg) and were extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM dNTP/ aa-UTP (Ambion, Austin, TX) mix at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Purified labelled cDNA was hybridised with S. aureus genome microarray version 4 as previously described by Mongodin et al. (2003) and Riordon et al. (2007). Briefly, the slides were prehybridized in a buffer containing 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA, and then washed and blown to dry. The two differentially labelled cDNA samples were dried and the resuspended in hybridization solution [40% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 µg/µl sheared Salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)]. The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h. After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC) for 10 min.

Scans were analyzed using TIGR-Spotfinder (www.tigr.org/software/) software and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalized by applying the LOWESS algorithm using TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software/) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/reference signal for each spot was recorded. Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded. The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html software using one class mode.

    <Summary>
Genome-wide transcriptional profiling studies of the growth of bacteria
 with antimicrobial agents often reveals aspects of the drug-specific
protective bacterial response. Fusidic acid is a steroid antimicrobial that
inhibits protein synthesis by interfering with the release of elongation
factor G (EF-G) after it has functioned in the translocation step. Two
 hundred and seventy two genes were both up- and down-regulated in a
 fusidic acid-susceptible strain of Staphylococcus aureus following
 challenge with 2 mg/L-1 fusidic acid for 15 min. Many genes altered by
 fusidic acid challenge are associated with protein synthesis such as fusA,
 which encodes EF-G which was up-regulated following exposure to the
 drug. The Staphylococcus microarray meta-database which curates and
 compares S. aureus transcriptome data revealed that the fusidic acid
 stimulon has the greatest overlap with the S. aureus cold shock- and
 stringent-responses. Six out of 9 autolysin genes making up the two
 component YycFG regulon (ssaA1-ssaA4, isaA and sceD) were also
 upregulated by fusidic acid; as were a carboxylesterase (est) and two
 putative Emr-Qac-like multidrug efflux pumps (emr-qac1 and emr-qac2).
 Genes down-regulated by fusidic acid induction encode a putative
 secreted acid phosphatase (sapS) and a number of protease genes
 (yjbG1, yjbG2, htrA1 and htrA2). Transcriptional analysis in conjunction
with mutant fusidic acid susceptibility experiments revealed that th45 e
 virulence gene regulatory agr operon, a YycFG controlled peptidoglycan
 hydrolase gene isaA and the proteases htrA1 and htrA2 are required for
 the expression of wild-type levels of fusidic acid susceptibility.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
S. aureus pangenome microarrays were utilized to determine transcriptome alterations occurring in S. aureus grown in the presence of  fusidic acid. Total bacterial RNA was isolated as previously described from S. aureus strain SH1000 grown in Muellar-Hinton broth to an OD580nm of 1.0 (37°C, 200 rpm) and then induced with 2 mg/L-1 fusidic acid for 15 min. This RNA and RNA isolated from untreated SH1000 cultures were then converted to fluorescently-labeled cDNA and hybridized to S. aureus microarrays version 4 (NIAID's Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center).  The Staphylococcus aureus microarray meta-database (SAMMD) curates data from various microarray  experiments and allows for the comparison of microarray data obtained from different protocols and experiments. SAMMD was used to analyze the transcriptome generated from SH1000 grown in the presence of  fusidic acid. Real-time PCR to confirm microarray data was performed. Following  growth of SH1000 with and without fusidic acid addition at various time points, the cultures were serial diluted with fresh MHB, inoculated onto Muellar Hinton agar and the total surviving CFUs/ml were determined after 24 h.
