To prepare cells for RNA extraction, an overnight culture of the relevant strain was grown under antibiotic selection where appropriate, and used to inoculate 1:100 25 ml of fresh antibiotic free LB  in a 250 ml flask incubated with shaking at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick Innova 3100 waterbath at 37C.

    <Data-Processing>
Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

To prepare cells for RNA extraction, an overnight culture of the relevant strain was grown under antibiotic selection where appropriate, and used to inoculate 1:100 25 ml of fresh antibiotic free LB  in a 250 ml flask incubated with shaking at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick Innova 3100 waterbath at 37C. Samples were removed for RNA extraction at 1 h, 4 h and 6 h after inoculation.

    <Data-Processing>
Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

To prepare cells for RNA extraction, an overnight culture of the relevant strain was grown under antibiotic selection where appropriate, and used to inoculate 1:100 25 ml of fresh antibiotic free LB  in a 250 ml flask incubated with shaking at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick Innova 3100 waterbath at 37C. Samples were removed for RNA extraction at 1 h, 4 h and 6 h after inoculation.

    <Data-Processing>
Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

To prepare cells for RNA extraction, an overnight culture of the relevant strain was grown under antibiotic selection where appropriate, and used to inoculate 1:100 25 ml of fresh antibiotic free LB  in a 250 ml flask incubated with shaking at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick Innova 3100 waterbath at 37C. Samples were removed for RNA extraction at 1 h, 4 h and 6 h after inoculation.

    <Data-Processing>
Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

To prepare cells for RNA extraction, an overnight culture of the relevant strain was grown under antibiotic selection where appropriate, and used to inoculate 1:100 25 ml of fresh antibiotic free LB  in a 250 ml flask incubated with shaking at 250 rpm in a New Brunswick Innova 3100 waterbath at 37C. Samples were removed for RNA extraction at 1 h, 4 h and 6 h after inoculation.

Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

Data centering was performed by bringing the median ratio (Cy5/Cy3) for each of the 16 blocks to one using the following equation: (Ti) = (Cy5i/Cy3i) - c, where T is the centered ratio, i is the gene index, Cy5 and Cy3 are the red and green intensities and c is the 50th percentile of all Cy5/Cy3 ratios. Flagged features are omitted from the data centering process. Because we used a microarray based on S. Typhimurium strain LT2 to analyse the transcriptional response of a different strain (S. Typhimurium strain SL1344), we removed all the data corresponding to genes present in LT2, but absent from SL1344.

    <Title>The nucleoid-associated protein HU controls three regulons that coordinate virulence and general physiology in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE22860</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>21212121</Pubmed-ID>
    <Web-Link>http://mic.sgmjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/mic.0.046359-0v1</Web-Link>
    <Summary>
The regulon of genes controlled by the HU nucleoid-associated proteins was examined in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium). DNA microarrays were used to detect the effect on the bacterial transcriptome of knockout mutations in the hupA, the hupB and in both the hupA and hupB genes. Distinct but overlapping patterns of gene expression were detected in the transcriptome at each time point for each of the three mutants, pointing to the existence of not one but three regulons of genes controlled by the HU proteins. Mutations in the hup genes altered the expression of regulatory and structural genes in both the SPI1 and the SPI2 pathogenicity islands. The hupA hupB double mutant was found to be defective in invasion of CACO2 and CHO epithelial cell lines and in its ability to survive in J774A.1 macrophage-like cells. The double mutant also had defective swarming activity and had a competitive fitness disadvantage compared to the wild type. In contrast, inactivation of just the hupB gene resulted in increased fitness and correlated with the up-regulation of members of the RpoS regulon in exponential phase cultures. Elimination of both the hupA and hupB genes resulted in strong down-regulation of the genes coding for the integration host factor, IHF, at all three time points.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The effect of hupA and hupB single-deletions and hupA and hupB double-deletion on S. Typhimurium gene expression during growth in LB was analysed at 3 different time points (1, 4 and 6 hours post-inoculation). Between two and three biological replicates, as well as technical replicates, were performed for each mutant and time point. For this study, we used Salmonella genomic DNA as the comparator which also acted as the control for spot quality.
