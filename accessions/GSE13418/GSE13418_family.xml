    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

The mRNA was purified from extracted total RNA with MICROBExpressTM (Ambion, Austin, TX) by removing the 16S and 23S ribosomal RNAs. The purified mRNA was polyadenylated with Poly(A) Polymerase (PAP), primed with an oligo(dT) primer bearing a T7 promoter by using MessageAmpTM II-Bacteria (Ambion). The second strand cDNA was synthesized from the obtained first strand cDNA.

    <Title>Gene expression of E. coli MG1655 at attachment, colony formation and maturation during biofilm formation</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>19376922</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Gene expression changes during biofilm formation processes were investigated. The gene expression was compared at attachment, colony formation and maturation during biofilm formation. At the same time, the gene expressions were also compared with exponential phase and stationary phase in planktonic cells. The gene expression pattern at attachment and colony formation processes showed similar pattern with those in planktonic exponential phase, and the gene expression pattern at maturation process showed similar pattern with those in planktonic stationary phase. During the maturation process, metabolic activities of the cells in the biofilms decreased, and the genes involved in the anaerobic respiration and efflux pumps were induced. The analysis revealed that gene expression pattern was changed and the physiological states were changed dramatically during maturation process in the biofilms.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Affymetrix E. coli antisense genome array was used to compare the gene expression among biofilm formation processes (attachment, colony formation and maturation) and planktonic cells (exponential phase and stationary phase). All samples were grown in MOPS minimal media with 0.2% glucose at 37ºC. Biofilms were grown on glass surface in flow cells (1 x 4 x 40 mm), and samples were taken at 2 h, 24 h and 72 h. Planktonic cell were grown for 6 h (exponential phase) and 24 h (stationary phase). Experiments were repeated 3 times, which resulted in 3 replicates of 5 different samples.
