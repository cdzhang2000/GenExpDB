    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (clinical or bovine-biased)+ sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR). SAM provided by TMEV was also used for data analysis.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC.

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (clinical or bovine-biased)+ sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR). SAM provided by TMEV was also used for data analysis.

5 ml of the culture was mixed with 1/10V 10% phenol:ethanol buffer to stabilize the RNA, and centrifuged at 4 oC, 4300 × g for 30 min to pellet cells.  The supernatant was decanted and cell pellets were suspended in 5 ml of buffer (2 mM EDTA, 20 mM NaOAc, pH 5.2) before mixing with equal volume of hot acid-phenol:chloroform (pH 4.5 with Iso Amyl Alcohol (IAA), 125:25:1) (Ambion, Austin, TX) and incubating at 65 oC with periodic shaking for 10 min.  The samples were centrifuged at 3220 × g for 20 min and the supernatant was subjected to further extractions with phenol:chloroform and chloroform:IAA (3).  RNA was precipitated overnight at -70 oC in 2.5 volume 100% ethanol and 1/10 volume 3 M sodium acetate pH 5.2.  RNA purification and DNase treatment of RNA samples were done with the Rneasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and RNA quality was assessed on a formaldehyde-agarose gel.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (clinical or bovine-biased)+ sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR). SAM provided by TMEV was also used for data analysis.

Significant differences in expression due to strain were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR). SAM provided by TMEV was also used for data analysis.

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (clinical or bovine-biased)+ sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC.

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (clinical or bovine-biased)+ sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR). SAM provided by TMEV was also used for data analysis.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC.

The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (clinical or bovine-biased)+ sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR). SAM provided by TMEV was also used for data analysis.

    <Title>Identification of differentially expressed genes between clinical and bovine-biased Escherichia coli O157:H7 genotypes</Title>

    <Summary>
Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains have been classified into different genotypes based on the presence of specific shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophage insertion sites.  Genotypes that are predominant in clinical isolates are named clinical genotypes and those that are isolated mostly from bovine sources are bovine-biased genotypes. To determine whether inherent differences in gene expression could possibly explain the variation in infectivity of these genotypes, we compared the expression patterns of O157:H7 strains isolated from cattle, which belonged to either clinical genotype 1 or bovine-biased genotype 5. Important virulence factors of O157, including locus of enterocyte effacement, enterohemolysin, and pO157 plasmid encoded genes, showed increased expression in clinical genotype. Genes essential for acid resistance such as gadA, gadB, and gadC and other stress fitness-associated genes were up-regulated in the bovine-biased genotype 5. Overall, these results suggest that clinical genotype 1 strains more commonly cause human illness because of an enhanced ability to express O157 virulence factors known to be important for disease pathogenesis.  By contrast, strains of the bovine-biased genotype 5 appear to be more resistant to adverse environmental conditions, which enable them to survive well in bovines without causing disease.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The results are based on O157:H7 clinical and bovine-biased genotype cultures grown in DMEM medium to exponential phase. Four strains were selected from each genotype and strains were considered as biological replicates. A double loop microarray design was used for comparing the samples. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to strain (clinical or bovine-biased) using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+strain+error. We incorporated the dye-swaps among the biological replicates.
