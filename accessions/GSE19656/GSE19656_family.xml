RNA was isolated from homogenized S. mutans cells grown in BHI medium buffered to pH 7.0 to OD600 of 0.4 by repeated hot acid-phenol:chloroform extractions, and the nucleic acid was precipitated with 1 volume ice-cold isopropanol and one-tenth volume 3M sodium acetate (pH 5) at –20°C overnight.  RNA pellets were resuspended in 80 mL nuclease-free H2O, and treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37°C for 30 minutes.  RNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 1 mL samples were run on an agarose gel to verify RNA integrity.  The RNA was purified again using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), including a second on-column DNase treatment that was performed as recommended by the supplier.  Final RNA concentrations were determined in triplicate.

Once RNA was purified as described above, cDNA was generated from 2ug RNA per sample as described by the protocol available from the Pathogen Functional Genomics Research Center (PFGRC) using Invitrogen Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) to increase cDNA yields.  Purified cDNAs were coupled to  Cy3 (experimental samples) or Cy5 (reference cDNA).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using software available at the J. Craig Venter Institute PFGRC website.  Single-channel images of the slides were loaded into Spotfinder and overlaid.  A spot grid was created according to PFGRC specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots.  The Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) software was used to normalize the spot intensity data using LOWESS and iterative log mean centering with default setting.  MIDAS also utilized In-Slide Replicate Analysis to average the intensities of the spots that were replicated on the microarray slide.  Spots that were missing or labeled as “bad” during the upstream processes in 50% of the slides were cut off in the output files, which also did not include control spots printed on the slides.   Statistical analysis was carried out with BRB array tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) with a cutoff P value of 0.001.

RNA was isolated from homogenized S. mutans cells grown in BHI medium buffered to pH 7.0 to OD600 of 0.4 by repeated hot acid-phenol:chloroform extractions, and the nucleic acid was precipitated with 1 volume ice-cold isopropanol and one-tenth volume 3M sodium acetate (pH 5) at –20°C overnight.  RNA pellets were resuspended in 80 mL nuclease-free H2O, and treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37°C for 30 minutes.  RNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 1 mL samples were run on an agarose gel to verify RNA integrity.  The RNA was purified again using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), including a second on-column DNase treatment that was performed as recommended by the supplier.  Final RNA concentrations were determined in triplicate.

Once RNA was purified as described above, cDNA was generated from 2ug RNA per sample as described by the protocol available from the Pathogen Functional Genomics Research Center (PFGRC) using Invitrogen Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) to increase cDNA yields.  Purified cDNAs were coupled to  Cy3 (experimental samples) or Cy5 (reference cDNA).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using software available at the J. Craig Venter Institute PFGRC website.  Single-channel images of the slides were loaded into Spotfinder and overlaid.  A spot grid was created according to PFGRC specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots.  The Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) software was used to normalize the spot intensity data using LOWESS and iterative log mean centering with default setting.  MIDAS also utilized In-Slide Replicate Analysis to average the intensities of the spots that were replicated on the microarray slide.  Spots that were missing or labeled as “bad” during the upstream processes in 50% of the slides were cut off in the output files, which also did not include control spots printed on the slides.   Statistical analysis was carried out with BRB array tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) with a cutoff P value of 0.001.

RNA was isolated from homogenized S. mutans cells grown in BHI medium buffered to pH 7.0 to OD600 of 0.4 by repeated hot acid-phenol:chloroform extractions, and the nucleic acid was precipitated with 1 volume ice-cold isopropanol and one-tenth volume 3M sodium acetate (pH 5) at –20°C overnight.  RNA pellets were resuspended in 80 mL nuclease-free H2O, and treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37°C for 30 minutes.  RNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 1 mL samples were run on an agarose gel to verify RNA integrity.  The RNA was purified again using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), including a second on-column DNase treatment that was performed as recommended by the supplier.  Final RNA concentrations were determined in triplicate.

Once RNA was purified as described above, cDNA was generated from 2ug RNA per sample as described by the protocol available from the Pathogen Functional Genomics Research Center (PFGRC) using Invitrogen Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) to increase cDNA yields.  Purified cDNAs were coupled to  Cy3 (experimental samples) or Cy5 (reference cDNA).

    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using software available at the J. Craig Venter Institute PFGRC website.  Single-channel images of the slides were loaded into Spotfinder and overlaid.  A spot grid was created according to PFGRC specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots.  The Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) software was used to normalize the spot intensity data using LOWESS and iterative log mean centering with default setting.  MIDAS also utilized In-Slide Replicate Analysis to average the intensities of the spots that were replicated on the microarray slide.  Spots that were missing or labeled as “bad” during the upstream processes in 50% of the slides were cut off in the output files, which also did not include control spots printed on the slides.   Statistical analysis was carried out with BRB array tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) with a cutoff P value of 0.001.

RNA was isolated from homogenized S. mutans cells grown in BHI medium buffered to pH 7.0 to OD600 of 0.4 by repeated hot acid-phenol:chloroform extractions, and the nucleic acid was precipitated with 1 volume ice-cold isopropanol and one-tenth volume 3M sodium acetate (pH 5) at –20°C overnight.  RNA pellets were resuspended in 80 mL nuclease-free H2O, and treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37°C for 30 minutes.  RNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 1 mL samples were run on an agarose gel to verify RNA integrity.  The RNA was purified again using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), including a second on-column DNase treatment that was performed as recommended by the supplier.  Final RNA concentrations were determined in triplicate.

Data were analyzed using software available at the J. Craig Venter Institute PFGRC website.  Single-channel images of the slides were loaded into Spotfinder and overlaid.  A spot grid was created according to PFGRC specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots.  The Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) software was used to normalize the spot intensity data using LOWESS and iterative log mean centering with default setting.  MIDAS also utilized In-Slide Replicate Analysis to average the intensities of the spots that were replicated on the microarray slide.  Spots that were missing or labeled as “bad” during the upstream processes in 50% of the slides were cut off in the output files, which also did not include control spots printed on the slides.   Statistical analysis was carried out with BRB array tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) with a cutoff P value of 0.001.

RNA was isolated from homogenized S. mutans cells grown in BHI medium buffered to pH 7.0 to OD600 of 0.4 by repeated hot acid-phenol:chloroform extractions, and the nucleic acid was precipitated with 1 volume ice-cold isopropanol and one-tenth volume 3M sodium acetate (pH 5) at –20°C overnight.  RNA pellets were resuspended in 80 mL nuclease-free H2O, and treated with DNase I (Ambion) at 37°C for 30 minutes.  RNA concentrations were determined using a Nanodrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA), and 1 mL samples were run on an agarose gel to verify RNA integrity.  The RNA was purified again using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), including a second on-column DNase treatment that was performed as recommended by the supplier.  Final RNA concentrations were determined in triplicate.

    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using software available at the J. Craig Venter Institute PFGRC website.  Single-channel images of the slides were loaded into Spotfinder and overlaid.  A spot grid was created according to PFGRC specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots.  The Microarray Data Analysis System (MIDAS) software was used to normalize the spot intensity data using LOWESS and iterative log mean centering with default setting.  MIDAS also utilized In-Slide Replicate Analysis to average the intensities of the spots that were replicated on the microarray slide.  Spots that were missing or labeled as “bad” during the upstream processes in 50% of the slides were cut off in the output files, which also did not include control spots printed on the slides.   Statistical analysis was carried out with BRB array tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) with a cutoff P value of 0.001.

    <Summary>
Transcriptional profiling to investigate the regulatory roles of SpxA and SpxB of S. mutans.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
RNA was extracted from four replicate samples of each strain of interest (spxA mutant, spxB mutant, spxAB double-mutant, UA159 wild type) and labeled with Cy3.  For each replicate, labeled RNA was hybridized to slides along with Cy5-labeled reference RNA, extracted from S. mutans UA159 cells grown to mid-log.
