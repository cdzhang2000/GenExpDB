    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

    <Title>Transcriptome analysis of wild type E. coli (K-12 MG1655) comparing to mutant E. coli strain (ECOM4) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions</Title>

    <Summary>
Cytochrome oxydases and quinol monooxygenase were removed from the E. coli genome resulting in oxygen-independent physiology
We used microarray profiling to identify perturbed metabolic or regulatory functionality resulting in the inability to undergo aerobic-anaerobic shift.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Affimetrics E. coli Arrays 2.0, Experiment (ECOM4) under both conditions (+O2/-O2) were analyzed in triplicates and compared to control (MG1655) under same conditions in triplicates
    </Overall-Design>
    <Type>Expression profiling by array</Type>
