    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
One volume of bacterial culture was added to two volumes of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen) and RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).  All samples were on-column treated with DNase I.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures of E. coli CFT073 were maintained at –80ºC in Luria-Bertani broth with 15% glycerol. Cultures were streaked onto LB agar plates and incubated (37°C, 24 h).  A single colony was inoculated into 150 mL of LB broth (in a 500 mL baffled flask).  Three inoculated flasks contained LB broth alone (controls), and three inoculated flasks were supplemented with cranberry derived PAC extract (100 µg/mL).Bacteria were incubated at 37°C, 5 h, 200 rpm to mid-log growth phase.

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with FlexArray 1.4.1 software program (http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/FlexArray/). The data were normalized using the Robust Multi-Array Average algorithm (RMA). Comparison between the two data sets was done using the Randomized Variance Model (RVM) with a cut-off of a fold change of 2 (or -2) and a P-value of 0.05.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
One volume of bacterial culture was added to two volumes of RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen) and RNA was extracted using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).  All samples were on-column treated with DNase I.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures of E. coli CFT073 were maintained at –80ºC in Luria-Bertani broth with 15% glycerol. Cultures were streaked onto LB agar plates and incubated (37°C, 24 h).  A single colony was inoculated into 150 mL of LB broth (in a 500 mL baffled flask).  Three inoculated flasks contained LB broth alone (controls), and three inoculated flasks were supplemented with cranberry derived PAC extract (100 µg/mL).Bacteria were incubated at 37°C, 5 h, 200 rpm to mid-log growth phase.

    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
GeneChips were scanned using the Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with FlexArray 1.4.1 software program (http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/FlexArray/). The data were normalized using the Robust Multi-Array Average algorithm (RMA). Comparison between the two data sets was done using the Randomized Variance Model (RVM) with a cut-off of a fold change of 2 (or -2) and a P-value of 0.05.

    <Title>Cranberry derived proanthocyanidins induce a state of iron-limitation in uropathogenic Escherichia coli CFT073 as revealed by microarray analysis</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE25745</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>21169441</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Transcriptional profiles of uropathogenic Escherichia coli CFT073 exposed to cranberry-derived proanthocyanidins (PACs) were determined. Our results indicate that bacteria grown on media supplemented with PACs were iron-deprived. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PACs have been shown to induce a state of iron-limitation in this bacterium.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Cultures of E. coli CFT073 were streaked onto LB agar plates and incubated (37°C, 24 h).  A single colony was inoculated into 150 mL of LB broth.  Three inoculated flasks contained LB broth alone (controls), and three inoculated flasks were supplemented with cranberry PACs (100 µg/mL).  After incubation (37°C, 5 h, 200 rpm to mid-log growth phase), bacteria were harvested for RNA extraction.
