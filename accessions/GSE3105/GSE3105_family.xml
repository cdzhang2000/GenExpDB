Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

    <Description>
Hybridization, washing and staining of microarrays was performed as recommended in the Affymetrix technical manual.  Briefly, the cDNA fragments were hybridized for 16 hours at 45oC to an Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli antisense microarray.  Arrays were washed at 25oC with non-stringent wash buffer, followed by a wash at 50oC with stringent buffer.  Then, the arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes).  The arrays were read at 570 nm with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 and the data were analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software.  Sample variations were standardized by scaling the average of all genes to constant target intensity of 500 for all arrays used.  The statistical significance of the data was analyzed by using rank-based (non-parametric) methods to generate p-values for each gene.  The data were passed through a first screen to discard absent genes, which have p-values &gt; 0.065.  Then, from the present (p-value &lt; 0.05) or moderate (p-value between 0.05 and 0.065) genes, only those with a signal ratio (pNM12/pBAD-ryhB) higher than 2 fold, positive or negative, were kept for further studies.  Operons were included in the Tables only if at least one gene within the operon had a ratio of over 2.  Usually, when the detection level was low (signal less than 200), the genes were discarded, unless otherwise indicated in the text (e.g. bfr).  Array experiments were done in duplicate and the reproducibility of the experiments is shown on the scatter plot of the values for all present genes (supplemental data: S2).  Genes repressed by RyhB in all three experiments (wild-type, fur, wild-type with added FeSO4) have been placed in Table 1.  Table 2 includes genes that are repressed by RyhB only in a fur+ background (unless indicated otherwise in the text).  Table 3 includes genes that were increased in expression upon RyhB expression.

The statistical significance of the data was analyzed by using rank-based (non-parametric) methods to generate p-values for each gene.  The data were passed through a first screen to discard absent genes, which have p-values &gt; 0.065.  Then, from the present (p-value &lt; 0.05) or moderate (p-value between 0.05 and 0.065) genes, only those with a signal ratio (pNM12/pBAD-ryhB) higher than 2 fold, positive or negative, were kept for further studies.  Operons were included in the Tables only if at least one gene within the operon had a ratio of over 2.  Usually, when the detection level was low (signal less than 200), the genes were discarded, unless otherwise indicated in the text (e.g. bfr).  Array experiments were done in duplicate and the reproducibility of the experiments is shown on the scatter plot of the values for all present genes (supplemental data: S2).  Genes repressed by RyhB in all three experiments (wild-type, fur, wild-type with added FeSO4) have been placed in Table 1.  Table 2 includes genes that are repressed by RyhB only in a fur+ background (unless indicated otherwise in the text).  Table 3 includes genes that were increased in expression upon RyhB expression.

    <Description>
Hybridization, washing and staining of microarrays was performed as recommended in the Affymetrix technical manual.  Briefly, the cDNA fragments were hybridized for 16 hours at 45oC to an Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli antisense microarray.  Arrays were washed at 25oC with non-stringent wash buffer, followed by a wash at 50oC with stringent buffer.  Then, the arrays were stained with phycoerythrin-conjugated streptavidin (Molecular Probes).  The arrays were read at 570 nm with a GeneChip Scanner 3000 and the data were analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite 5.0 software.  Sample variations were standardized by scaling the average of all genes to constant target intensity of 500 for all arrays used.  The statistical significance of the data was analyzed by using rank-based (non-parametric) methods to generate p-values for each gene.  The data were passed through a first screen to discard absent genes, which have p-values &gt; 0.065.  Then, from the present (p-value &lt; 0.05) or moderate (p-value between 0.05 and 0.065) genes, only those with a signal ratio (pNM12/pBAD-ryhB) higher than 2 fold, positive or negative, were kept for further studies.  Operons were included in the Tables only if at least one gene within the operon had a ratio of over 2.  Usually, when the detection level was low (signal less than 200), the genes were discarded, unless otherwise indicated in the text (e.g. bfr).  Array experiments were done in duplicate and the reproducibility of the experiments is shown on the scatter plot of the values for all present genes (supplemental data: S2).  Genes repressed by RyhB in all three experiments (wild-type, fur, wild-type with added FeSO4) have been placed in Table 1.  Table 2 includes genes that are repressed by RyhB only in a fur+ background (unless indicated otherwise in the text).  Table 3 includes genes that were increased in expression upon RyhB expression.

Then, from the present (p-value &lt; 0.05) or moderate (p-value between 0.05 and 0.065) genes, only those with a signal ratio (pNM12/pBAD-ryhB) higher than 2 fold, positive or negative, were kept for further studies.  Operons were included in the Tables only if at least one gene within the operon had a ratio of over 2.  Usually, when the detection level was low (signal less than 200), the genes were discarded, unless otherwise indicated in the text (e.g. bfr).  Array experiments were done in duplicate and the reproducibility of the experiments is shown on the scatter plot of the values for all present genes (supplemental data: S2).  Genes repressed by RyhB in all three experiments (wild-type, fur, wild-type with added FeSO4) have been placed in Table 1.  Table 2 includes genes that are repressed by RyhB only in a fur+ background (unless indicated otherwise in the text).  Table 3 includes genes that were increased in expression upon RyhB expression.

    <Title>Effect of small RNA RyhB on global iron use in Escherichia coli</Title>

    <Summary>
RyhB is a non-coding RNA regulated by the Fur repressor.  It has previously been shown to cause the rapid degradation of a number of mRNAs that encode proteins that utilize iron.  Here we examine the effect of ectopic RyhB production on global gene expression by microarray analysis.  Many of the previously identified targets were found, as well as other mRNAs encoding iron-binding proteins, bringing the total number of regulated operons to at least 18, encoding 56 genes.   The two major operons involved in Fe-S cluster assembly showed different behavior; the isc operon appears to be a direct target of RyhB action, while the suf operon does not.  This is consistent with previous findings suggesting that the suf genes but not the isc genes are important for Fe-S cluster synthesis under iron-limiting conditions, presumably for essential iron-binding proteins.  In addition, we observed repression of Fur-regulated genes upon RyhB expression, interpreted as due to intracellular iron-sparing resulting from reduced synthesis of iron-binding proteins.  Our results demonstrate the broad effects of a single non-coding RNA on iron homeostasis.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Derivatives of MG1655 carrying either pBAD-ryhB or the control vector pNM12 were used in all experiments. 
The strains used contain the (delta)ara714 allele to prevent catabolism of arabinose and the (delta)ryhB::cat allele to restrict RyhB expression to the inducible pBAD-ryhB vector.  
Overnight bacterial cultures were incubated in LB media with ampicillin at a final concentration of 50 ug/mL at 37oC and diluted 1000-fold into 50 mL of fresh LB-ampicillin media at 37oC with agitation.  To induce RyhB expression, cultures carrying the pBAD-ryhB construct were grown to an O.D.600 of 0.5 and arabinose was added to the culture at a final concentration of 0.1%.  In some experiments, 50 uM FeSO4 was added to the new culture after dilution from overnight culture. Total RNA was extracted from cells at the indicated time using the hot phenol procedure.
