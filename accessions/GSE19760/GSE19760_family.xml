Overnight cultures of E. coli were diluted 1:100 in 25 ml LB broth and grown to mid-log phase (OD600 = 0.25) under hypoxic conditions (2% O2) shaking at 250 rpm. Reuterin-containing cell-free supernatant that had been determined to have a MIC assay value of 32 units reuterin/ml was added to the culture at 1/5 of the total culture volume. 2X LB broth was added at the same time to maintain the same nutrient concentration. The cells were allowed to double before samples were removed for RNA extraction.

Samples of cells taken for RNA isolation were immediately mixed with an equal volume of prechilled methanol (-20°C) and kept at room temperature for 1 to 2 min.

10 µg of total RNA was incubated with 2.5 µg of random hexamers in a final volume of 17.8 µl at 70°C for 10 min and then placed on ice for 4 min. 12.2 µl of a labeling mix containing Superscript III reverse transcriptase buffer (Invitrogen), 10 mM dithiothreitol, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.3 mM dTTP, and 0.2 mM 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-dUTP), 20 units RNase Out (Invitrogen) and 300 units Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added to the RNA-primer mixture and incubated at 25°C for 5 min and then at 50°C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by heating the reaction mixture to 70°C for 15 minutes. RNA was hydrolyzed by adding 15 µl 0.1M sodium hydroxide and incubating the mixture at 70°C for 10 minutes, then adding 15 µl 0.1M hydrochloric acid and 40 µl water. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by using Qiagen MinElute spin columns (Qiagen) and samples were eluted from the columns using 10 µl water. For the coupling reaction, 0.5 µl 1M sodium carbonate (pH 9) was added to the eluent and the mixture was used to resuspend either Cy5 or Cy3 dye aliquots (CyDye Post-labeling Reactive Dye Pack, GE Healthcare), incubated at 25°C for 1 hour, and purified using Qiagen MinElute spin columns (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Microarray slides that were cross-linked by exposure to 350 mJ UV were prehybridized at 42°C for 1 hour in 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.01% (w/v) BSA. The slides were submersed in water, then submersed in 100% isopropanol, then allowed to dry. The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined then denatured at 95C for 5 minutes in the presence of 0.1µg/ml yeast tRNA and 0.1µg/ml salmon testes DNA. Slides were hybridized in a total volume of 200 µl with denatured probe, 50% formamide, 10XSSC, 0.1% SDS in an Agilent G2534A microarray hybridization chamber (Agilent Technologies) at 42°C overnight. Slides were washed for 4 minutes at 42°C in 1× SSC and 0.2% SDS, 4 minutes at 25°C in 0.1× SSC and 0.2% SDS, then 4 minutes at 25°C in 1× SSC.

    <Data-Processing>
Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices). To be considered a valid signal, 40% of the pixels in a spot had to be at least 1 standard deviation above the local background in at least one of the channels. Spots not making this cutoff were excluded from further analysis. Because many of the genes in the analysis are expressed under only one condition, we had to assign a value to the spots that did not contain a significant signal in one channel. This value was the lowest signal in a channel that met our criterion of being at least 1 standard deviation above background. Background signal was not subtracted from the signal intensity of the spots. Once spots with significant signals were identified, the two channels were normalized by making the total signal in each of the channels equal. Microarray data were analyzed using iterative outlier analysis with three iterations. Briefly, iterative outlier analysis calculates the geometric mean and standard deviation of the entire data set. Differentially expressed genes (outliers) were selected as being more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean of the population. To identify additional differentially expressed genes in the data set, the outliers were removed, the geometric mean and standard deviations were recalculated, and any genes that were more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean were identified as differentially expressed.

10 µg of total RNA was incubated with 2.5 µg of random hexamers in a final volume of 17.8 µl at 70°C for 10 min and then placed on ice for 4 min. 12.2 µl of a labeling mix containing Superscript III reverse transcriptase buffer (Invitrogen), 10 mM dithiothreitol, deoxynucleoside triphosphates (0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.3 mM dTTP, and 0.2 mM 5-(3-Aminoallyl)-dUTP), 20 units RNase Out (Invitrogen) and 300 units Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) was added to the RNA-primer mixture and incubated at 25°C for 5 min and then at 50°C for 60 min. The reaction was stopped by heating the reaction mixture to 70°C for 15 minutes. RNA was hydrolyzed by adding 15 µl 0.1M sodium hydroxide and incubating the mixture at 70°C for 10 minutes, then adding 15 µl 0.1M hydrochloric acid and 40 µl water. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed by using Qiagen MinElute spin columns (Qiagen) and samples were eluted from the columns using 10 µl water. For the coupling reaction, 0.5 µl 1M sodium carbonate (pH 9) was added to the eluent and the mixture was used to resuspend either Cy5 or Cy3 dye aliquots (CyDye Post-labeling Reactive Dye Pack, GE Healthcare), incubated at 25°C for 1 hour, and purified using Qiagen MinElute spin columns (Qiagen).

Microarray slides that were cross-linked by exposure to 350 mJ UV were prehybridized at 42°C for 1 hour in 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.01% (w/v) BSA. The slides were submersed in water, then submersed in 100% isopropanol, then allowed to dry. The Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined then denatured at 95C for 5 minutes in the presence of 0.1µg/ml yeast tRNA and 0.1µg/ml salmon testes DNA. Slides were hybridized in a total volume of 200 µl with denatured probe, 50% formamide, 10XSSC, 0.1% SDS in an Agilent G2534A microarray hybridization chamber (Agilent Technologies) at 42°C overnight.

Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices). To be considered a valid signal, 40% of the pixels in a spot had to be at least 1 standard deviation above the local background in at least one of the channels. Spots not making this cutoff were excluded from further analysis. Because many of the genes in the analysis are expressed under only one condition, we had to assign a value to the spots that did not contain a significant signal in one channel. This value was the lowest signal in a channel that met our criterion of being at least 1 standard deviation above background. Background signal was not subtracted from the signal intensity of the spots. Once spots with significant signals were identified, the two channels were normalized by making the total signal in each of the channels equal. Microarray data were analyzed using iterative outlier analysis with three iterations. Briefly, iterative outlier analysis calculates the geometric mean and standard deviation of the entire data set. Differentially expressed genes (outliers) were selected as being more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean of the population. To identify additional differentially expressed genes in the data set, the outliers were removed, the geometric mean and standard deviations were recalculated, and any genes that were more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean were identified as differentially expressed.

Microarray data were analyzed using iterative outlier analysis with three iterations. Briefly, iterative outlier analysis calculates the geometric mean and standard deviation of the entire data set. Differentially expressed genes (outliers) were selected as being more than 2.5 standard deviations away from the mean of the population. To identify additional differentially expressed genes in the data set, the outliers were removed, the geometric mean and standard deviations were recalculated, and any genes that were more than 2.5 standard deviations from the mean were identified as differentially expressed.

    <Pubmed-ID>20150236</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Transcriptional profiling of E. coli DH5alpha cells comparing control untreated cells with cells exposed to sublethal concentrations of reuterin (3-hydroxypropionaldehyde).
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Two-condition experiment, reuterin-treated vs. untreated control E. coli DH5alpha cells. 5 biological replicate sets of reuterin-treated vs. untreated cells which were independently grown and harvested. Each array is probed with 1 replicate set.
