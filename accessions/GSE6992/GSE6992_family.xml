    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

Paraquat was added to growing cultures at a final concentration of 250 ?M. Samples (1.4ml) were taken every 2 minutes following paraquat treatment for the length of the time course, and flash-frozen by immersion of the tubes in liquid nitrogen.

    <Title>Expression data from a paraquat time course experiment in wild type and SoxR deficient strains</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE6992</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>18000553</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
SoxR and SoxS constitute an intracellular signal response system that rapidly detects changes in superoxide levels and modulates gene expression in E. coli.
A time series microarray design was used to identify co-regulated SoxRS dependent and independent genes affected by superoxide
Keywords: time course
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
To determine the immediate transcriptional response of E. coli to superoxide, we conducted a time series assay of mRNA levels immediately following the addition of paraquat.  The wild type strain MG1655 and a strain with a precise deletion in soxR was grown in EZ Rich Defined Medium, a modification of Neidhardtâs defined rich medium.  When cultures reached an OD600=0.5, 250ÂµM paraquat (PQ) was added, a concentration that triggers the SoxRS transcriptional cascade, but only has a small effect on exponential growth rate in rich media. Samples were taken immediately before exposure to PQ, and every 2 minutes after exposure, for 10 minutes.
