Cells were harvested from 15 ml aliquots of bacterial culture by centrifugation at 5800 x g for 10 mins.  Cell pellets were treated with lysozyme (10 mg/ml) for 15 mins prior to RNA extraction using TriZol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Repeated rounds to DNase I digestion and Trizol extraction were performed until  DNA contaminiation was removed.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Microarrays were pre-hybridised in a solution of 25 % formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1 % SDS and 10 mg/ml of herring sperm DNA at 42˚C for 45 mins.  Labelled cDNA was hybridised to the prehybridised microarrays according to the instructions provided with the Geneisphere 3DNA 900MPX kit
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The dried microarrays were scanned using a GMS418 microarray scanner (Affymetrix), scans were aquired using GMS scanner software (V.1.51.0.42) (Affymetrix) and quantified using Imagene version 5.1 (BioDiscovery).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Quantified ImaGene files from four independant microarray experiments were analysed using the LIMMA software package for R.  Each microarray experiment was performed using an independant biological replicate, thus providing four independant biological replicates with two dye-swaps.  Spot intensities were firstly normalised per print tip group before being normalised between arrays using a Lowess algorithm.  Spot intensities were then log2 transformed and expression values calculated as the ratio of log2 intensity of revR mutant/wild-type.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Gene expression was compared between a revRmutant of C. perfringens strain 13 and wild-type
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bacterial strains were cultured for 4 hrs at 37˚C in sterile TPYG broth (5 % [w/v] tryptone, 0.5 % [w/v] proteose peptone, 0.3 % [w/v] yeast extract and 0.1 % [w/v] sodium thioglycolate, supplimented with sterile glucose to a final concentration of 0.38 % [v/v] after autoclaving) under anaerobic conditions.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Cells were harvested from 15 ml aliquots of bacterial culture by centrifugation at 5800 x g for 10 mins.  Cell pellets were treated with lysozyme (10 mg/ml) for 15 mins prior to RNA extraction using TriZol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Repeated rounds to DNase I digestion and Trizol extraction were performed until  DNA contaminiation was removed.

      <Label>Cy5</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA synthesis and labelling with Cy3 or Cy5 using 4 μg of total RNA was performed according to the Genisphere 3DNA 900MPX kit (Genisphere) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Microarrays were pre-hybridised in a solution of 25 % formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1 % SDS and 10 mg/ml of herring sperm DNA at 42˚C for 45 mins.  Labelled cDNA was hybridised to the prehybridised microarrays according to the instructions provided with the Geneisphere 3DNA 900MPX kit
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The dried microarrays were scanned using a GMS418 microarray scanner (Affymetrix), scans were aquired using GMS scanner software (V.1.51.0.42) (Affymetrix) and quantified using Imagene version 5.1 (BioDiscovery).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
Quantified ImaGene files from four independant microarray experiments were analysed using the LIMMA software package for R.  Each microarray experiment was performed using an independant biological replicate, thus providing four independant biological replicates with two dye-swaps.  Spot intensities were firstly normalised per print tip group before being normalised between arrays using a Lowess algorithm.  Spot intensities were then log2 transformed and expression values calculated as the ratio of log2 intensity of revR mutant/wild-type.

    <Summary>
RevR is a putative orphan response regulator with a high degree of similarity to YycF from Bacilus subtilis and PhoB from Clostridium kluyveri.  A revR deletion mutant of C. perfringens strain 13 was generated and the transcriptome analysed using microarrays.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells from the revR mutant and the wild-type control.  Gene expression levels were compared between the revR mutant and wild-type strain 13
