A 1/10 volume of 10% phenol in ethanol stop solution was added to the 50 mL MAJ with culture, vortexed, and poured over 1% phenol, 10% ethanol ice. Samples were centrifuged immediately at 6000 rpm, 4ºC for 30 min to pellet cells.  The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were suspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM sodium actetate, 2mM EDTA) and immediately mixed with 5mL of hot acid phenol:chloroform.  Samples were held at 65ºC with periodic shaking for at least 10 minutes before centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 20 min.  Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1).  RNA was precipitated overnight at –80ºC in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2.  RNA samples were purified and treated with DNase using the Rneasy kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Raw intensity values for each array were normalized using pin-tip LOWESS in R (52)  with the MAANOVA (v. 0.98-8) package.  Signals from two replicate probes on each array were averaged and log2 transformation applied. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), treatment (MOPS or MAJ) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+treatment+phase*treatment.  The ANOVA modeling allows for consideration of appropriate error structures for experiments with multiple sources of variation in microarray measurements (37). The random effects of the model were biological replicate and array effects, whereas the fixed effects were growth phase, treatment, and dye effects (18).  The Fs statistic, a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumptions about the distribution of variances across genes, was estimated (19).  Significant changes in expression over time were determined by calculating the p values for the Fs statistic for each gene using 1000 random permutations.  The p-values were adjusted to correct for type I error with the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) linear step-up correction implemented in R/MAANOVA and a cutoff adjusted p-value of 0.05.  Fold change in expression between treatments and growth phases was determined by calculating the difference in log2 expression between the treatments or growth phases of interest.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Raw intensity values for each array were normalized using pin-tip LOWESS in R (52) with the MAANOVA (v. 0.98-8) package. Signals from two replicate probes on each array were averaged and log2 transformation applied. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), treatment (MOPS or MAJ) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+treatment+phase*treatment. The ANOVA modeling allows for consideration of appropriate error structures for experiments with multiple sources of variation in microarray measurements (37). The random effects of the model were biological replicate and array effects, whereas the fixed effects were growth phase, treatment, and dye effects (18). The Fs statistic, a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumptions about the distribution of variances across genes, was estimated (19). Significant changes in expression over time were determined by calculating the p values for the Fs statistic for each gene using 1000 random permutations. The p-values were adjusted to correct for type I error with the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) linear step-up correction implemented in R/MAANOVA and a cutoff adjusted p-value of 0.05. Fold change in expression between treatments and growth phases was determined by calculating the difference in log2 expression between the treatments or growth phases of interest.

A 1/10 volume of 10% phenol in ethanol stop solution was added to the 50 mL MAJ with culture, vortexed, and poured over 1% phenol, 10% ethanol ice. Samples were centrifuged immediately at 6000 rpm, 4ºC for 30 min to pellet cells. The supernatant was removed and cell pellets were suspended in 5 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM sodium actetate, 2mM EDTA) and immediately mixed with 5mL of hot acid phenol:chloroform. Samples were held at 65ºC with periodic shaking for at least 10 minutes before centrifuging at 4000 rpm for 20 min. Supernatant was extracted again with acid-phenol:chloroform and then with chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24.1). RNA was precipitated overnight at –80ºC in 2.5V 100% ethanol and 1/10V 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2. RNA samples were purified and treated with DNase using the Rneasy kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Raw intensity values for each array were normalized using pin-tip LOWESS in R (52) with the MAANOVA (v. 0.98-8) package. Signals from two replicate probes on each array were averaged and log2 transformation applied. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), treatment (MOPS or MAJ) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+treatment+phase*treatment. The ANOVA modeling allows for consideration of appropriate error structures for experiments with multiple sources of variation in microarray measurements (37). The random effects of the model were biological replicate and array effects, whereas the fixed effects were growth phase, treatment, and dye effects (18). The Fs statistic, a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumptions about the distribution of variances across genes, was estimated (19). Significant changes in expression over time were determined by calculating the p values for the Fs statistic for each gene using 1000 random permutations. The p-values were adjusted to correct for type I error with the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) linear step-up correction implemented in R/MAANOVA and a cutoff adjusted p-value of 0.05. Fold change in expression between treatments and growth phases was determined by calculating the difference in log2 expression between the treatments or growth phases of interest.

The random effects of the model were biological replicate and array effects, whereas the fixed effects were growth phase, treatment, and dye effects (18). The Fs statistic, a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumptions about the distribution of variances across genes, was estimated (19). Significant changes in expression over time were determined by calculating the p values for the Fs statistic for each gene using 1000 random permutations. The p-values were adjusted to correct for type I error with the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) linear step-up correction implemented in R/MAANOVA and a cutoff adjusted p-value of 0.05. Fold change in expression between treatments and growth phases was determined by calculating the difference in log2 expression between the treatments or growth phases of interest.

Raw intensity values for each array were normalized using pin-tip LOWESS in R (52) with the MAANOVA (v. 0.98-8) package. Signals from two replicate probes on each array were averaged and log2 transformation applied. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), treatment (MOPS or MAJ) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+treatment+phase*treatment.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5x SSC, and 1mg/mL BSA at 42C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC and 2x 30s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95C for 5 min and then mixed with 40uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47C for 16-18h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2x SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2x 5 min in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS 37C, and then 2x 2.5min in room temperature 0.1x SSC.

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Raw intensity values for each array were normalized using pin-tip LOWESS in R (52) with the MAANOVA (v. 0.98-8) package. Signals from two replicate probes on each array were averaged and log2 transformation applied. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), treatment (MOPS or MAJ) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+treatment+phase*treatment. The ANOVA modeling allows for consideration of appropriate error structures for experiments with multiple sources of variation in microarray measurements (37). The random effects of the model were biological replicate and array effects, whereas the fixed effects were growth phase, treatment, and dye effects (18). The Fs statistic, a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumptions about the distribution of variances across genes, was estimated (19). Significant changes in expression over time were determined by calculating the p values for the Fs statistic for each gene using 1000 random permutations. The p-values were adjusted to correct for type I error with the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) linear step-up correction implemented in R/MAANOVA and a cutoff adjusted p-value of 0.05. Fold change in expression between treatments and growth phases was determined by calculating the difference in log2 expression between the treatments or growth phases of interest.

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.

    <Data-Processing>
Raw intensity values for each array were normalized using pin-tip LOWESS in R (52) with the MAANOVA (v. 0.98-8) package. Signals from two replicate probes on each array were averaged and log2 transformation applied. Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), treatment (MOPS or MAJ) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+treatment+phase*treatment. The ANOVA modeling allows for consideration of appropriate error structures for experiments with multiple sources of variation in microarray measurements (37). The random effects of the model were biological replicate and array effects, whereas the fixed effects were growth phase, treatment, and dye effects (18). The Fs statistic, a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumptions about the distribution of variances across genes, was estimated (19). Significant changes in expression over time were determined by calculating the p values for the Fs statistic for each gene using 1000 random permutations. The p-values were adjusted to correct for type I error with the Benjamini-Hochberg (B-H) linear step-up correction implemented in R/MAANOVA and a cutoff adjusted p-value of 0.05. Fold change in expression between treatments and growth phases was determined by calculating the difference in log2 expression between the treatments or growth phases of interest.

    <Summary>
Escherichia coli O157:H7 has caused serious outbreaks of foodborne illness via transmission in a variety of food vehicles, including unpasteurized apple juice, dried salami, and spinach.  To understand how this pathogen responds to the multiple stresses of the food environment, we compared global transcription patterns after exposure to apple juice.  Transcriptomes of mid-exponential and stationary phase cells were evaluated after 10 minutes in model apple juice (pH3.5) using microarrays probing 4,886 ORFs.  Significant changes in gene expression were determined using R/MAANOVA and the Fs test. A total of 331 ORFs were significantly induced upon exposure of cells to model apple juice and included genes involved in the acid and osmotic stress responses as well as the oxidative stress response and envelope stress.  Genes involved in the acid and osmotic stress responses, including asr, osmC, osmB, and osmY were significantly induced in response to model apple juice.   Genes involved in the envelope stress response, known to be controlled by CpxR (cpxP, degP, and htpX), were significantly induced 2 to 15 fold upon exposure to apple juice, independent of growth phase.  Inactivation of CpxRA resulted in a significant decrease in survival of O157:H7 in model apple juice compared to the isogenic parent strain.  Of the 331 ORFs induced in model apple juice, 104 are O157-specific ORFs, including those encoding type three secretion effectors espJ, espB, espM2, espL3 and espZ.  By elucidating the response of O157:H7 to acidic foods, we hope to gain insights into how this pathogen is able to survive in food matrices and how exposure to foods affects subsequent transmission and virulence.

    <Overall-Design>
The results are based on O157:H7 Sakai exponential and stationary phase cultures grown in MOPS minimal medium and then exposed to model apple juice (pH 3.5, 37C) for 10 minutes.  Differences in transcript levels were determined using a mixed model ANOVA in R/MAANOVA which tested for significant differences due to growth phase (exponential or stationary), treatment (MOPS or MAJ) and the interaction of these two factors using the following linear model: array+dye+sample (biological replicate)+ phase+treatment+phase*treatment.   We incorporated the dye-swaps among the biological replicates.
