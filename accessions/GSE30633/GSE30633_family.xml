Slides were cross-linked in a Stratalinker (Stratagene), using the “auto-link” function at 3000ujoulesx100. Prior to hybridization, slides were pre-hybridized for 2 hours at room temperature in 0.2% SDS then rinsed in filtered water (10 sec) then in 70%.EtOH (5sec). Slides were dried by centrifugation at 1000rpm for 3 min.

Labeled cDNA was mixed to 500ul of Ambion SlideHyb#3 hybridization buffer (cat# AM8863). Hybridization mix was spin at 15,000xg for 5 min, denatured at 98C for 2 min and kept at 70C until loading onto the slide. Hybridization was performed in the Agilent hybridization chambers and oven for 18hrs, at 50C, rotation setting at 7.  At the end of hybridization, slides were disassembled in 0.2xSSC/0.1%SDS, washed for 15 min at RT in 0.2xSSC/0.1%SDS, then 15min at RT in 0.1xSSC and dried by centrifugation at 1000rpm for 3 min.

Mycobacterium smegmatis strains mgm182 (site(+)) and mgm181 (site(-)) were grown to an OD600 of 0.7 (log) or &gt;2.0 (stationary). Samples were collected for the T=0 timepoint and then a final concentration of 50ng/ml of ATc was added. 15 minutes and 45 minutes later samples were collected (T=15 and T=45, respectively).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was mixed to 500ul of Ambion SlideHyb#3 hybridization buffer (cat# AM8863). Hybridization mix was spin at 15,000xg for 5 min, denatured at 98C for 2 min and kept at 70C until loading onto the slide. Hybridization was performed in the Agilent hybridization chambers and oven for 18hrs, at 50C, rotation setting at 7.  At the end of hybridization, slides were disassembled in 0.2xSSC/0.1%SDS, washed for 15 min at RT in 0.2xSSC/0.1%SDS, then 15min at RT in 0.1xSSC and dried by centrifugation at 1000rpm for 3 min.

    <Title>Mycobacterium smegmatis: I-SceI homing endonuclease generated genomic DNA damage (site(+), mgm182) vs control (site(-), mgm181)</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>21789183</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Transcriptional profiling of Mycobacterium smegmatis comparing a strain undergoing I-SceI generated DNA damage at a single genomic locus versus a control strain with no I-SceI recognition sequence in its genome (and thus not undergoing double strand DNA breaks
Gene designations are from the original annotation, not the updated
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Five conditions investigated: Log phase cultures without induction of I-SceI expression (T=0, -Atc), Log phase cultures induced to express I-SceI by the addition of ATc for 45 minutes (T=45, +ATc), Stationary cultures control without induction of I-SceI expression (T=0, -Atc), Stationary phase cultures induced to express I-SceI by the addition of ATc for 15 minutes (T=15, +ATc), and Stationary cultures induced to express I-SceI for 45 minutes by the addition of ATc (T=45, +ATc). 3 biological replicates of each strain for each experiment.
