    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

Gene expression data for W3110 luxS mutant grown in LB medium at OD 2.4
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Microarray data were analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software version 5.1 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and the four-comparison survival method (7). The fluorescence of each array was normalized by scaling total chip fluorescence intensities to a common value of 500. For each growth condition, two independent experimental cell cultures (wild type) were compared with two independent control groups ( luxS mutant), and four comparisons were made. The fold change for each gene was calculated as the ratio of signal intensity for the wild type to the signal intensity for the  luxS mutant. The reported value for the fold change is the average of the four comparisons. Genes with a consistent increase or decrease in all comparisons were determined and used for the analysis.

Gene expression data for E. coli W3110 luxS mutant grown in LB medium at OD 2.4
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Microarray data were analyzed with the Affymetrix Microarray Suite software version 5.1 (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and the four-comparison survival method. The fluorescence of each array was normalized by scaling total chip fluorescence intensities to a common value of 500. For each growth condition, two independent experimental cell cultures (wild type) were compared with two independent control groups ( luxS mutant), and four comparisons were made. The fold change for each gene was calculated as the ratio of signal intensity for the wild type to the signal intensity for the  luxS mutant. The reported value for the fold change is the average of the four comparisons. Genes with a consistent increase or decrease in all comparisons were determined and used for the analysis.

    <Summary>
The bacterial quorum-sensing autoinducer 2 (AI-2) has received intense interest because the gene for its synthase, luxS, is common among a large number of bacterial species. We have identified luxS-controlled genes in Escherichia coli under two different growth conditions using DNA microarrays. Twenty-three genes were affected by luxS deletion in the presence of glucose, and 63 genes were influenced by luxS deletion in the absence of glucose. Minimal overlap among these gene sets suggests the role of luxS is condition dependent. Under the latter condition, the metE gene, the lsrACDBFG operon, and the flanking genes of the lsr operon (lsrR, lsrK, tam, and yneE) were among the most significantly induced genes by luxS. The E. coli lsr operon includes an additional gene, tam, encoding an S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferase. Also, lsrR and lsrK belong to the same operon, lsrRK, which is positively regulated by the cyclic AMP receptor protein and negatively regulated by LsrR. lsrK is additionally transcribed by a promoter between lsrR and lsrK. Deletion of luxS was also shown to affect genes involved in methionine biosynthesis, methyl transfer reactions, iron uptake, and utilization of carbon. It was surprising, however, that so few genes were affected by luxS deletion in this E. coli K-12 strain under these conditions. Most of the highly induced genes are related to AI-2 production and transport. These data are consistent with the function of LuxS as an important metabolic enzyme but appear not to support the role of AI-2 as a true signal molecule for E. coli W3110 under the investigated conditions.
