    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays, according to the manufacturer’s Prokaryotic Target Preparation Assay. Briefly, 10 ug of total RNA containing spiked in Poly-A RNA controls (GeneChip Expression GeneChip Eukaryotic Poly-A RNA Control Kit; Affymetrix) was used in a reverse transcription reaction with random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) to generate first-strand cDNA. After removal of RNA, 1.5 ug of cDNA was fragmented with DNase and end-labeled (GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling Kit; Affymetrix). Size distribution of the fragmented and end-labeled cDNA, respectively, was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a RNA 6000 Nano Assay.
      </Label-Protocol>

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
1 µg of end-labeled, fragmented cDNA was used in a 80-µl hybridization cocktail containing added hybridization controls and hybridized on arrays for 16 h at 45°C. Standard post hybridization wash and double-stain protocols (FS450_0006; GeneChip HWS kit, Affymetrix) were used on an Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450.

RNA was processed for use on Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA, USA) GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays, according to the manufacturer’s Prokaryotic Target Preparation Assay. Briefly, 10 ug of total RNA containing spiked in Poly-A RNA controls (GeneChip Expression GeneChip Eukaryotic Poly-A RNA Control Kit; Affymetrix) was used in a reverse transcription reaction with random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) to generate first-strand cDNA. After removal of RNA, 1.5 ug of cDNA was fragmented with DNase and end-labeled (GeneChip® WT Terminal Labeling Kit; Affymetrix). Size distribution of the fragmented and end-labeled cDNA, respectively, was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer with a RNA 6000 Nano Assay.

    <Pubmed-ID>19246752</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
We recently reported that carbon monoxide (CO) has bactericidal activity. To understand its mode of action we analysed the gene expression changes occurring when Escherichia coli, grown aerobically and anaerobically, is treated with the carbon monoxide releasing molecule, CORM-2. The E. coli microarray analysis shows that E. coli CORM-2 response is multifaceted with a high number of differentially regulated genes spread through several functional categories, namely genes involved in inorganic ion transport and metabolism, regulators, and genes implicated in posttranslational modification, such as chaperones. CORM-2 has higher impact in E. coli cells grown anaerobically, as judged by the existence of repressed genes belonging to eight functional classes which are absent in aerobically CORM-2 treated cells. In spite of the relatively stable nature of the CO molecule, our results show that CO is able to trigger a significant alteration in the transcriptome of E. coli which necessarily has effects in several key metabolic pathways. 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Total RNA from two independent cultures of cells grown either aerobically or anaerobically and treated with 250 μM CORM-2 during 15 min or left untreated were processed for use in the Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Arrays were scanned in an Affymetrix GeneChip scanner 2500 and analysed first with Affymetrix MAS 5.0 software to obtain Absent/Present calls and to assure that all quality parameters were within the recommended range. Hybridization, scanning and detection procedures were done at the Genomics Unit of Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência (Portugal).
