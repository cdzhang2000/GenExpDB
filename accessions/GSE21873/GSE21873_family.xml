      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA (10 µg) from treatment and control was used to synthesis cDNA using random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and then centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and Aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs were labeled with Cy-3 mono-Reactive Dye and Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care)

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A total of six slides were used. S. Typhimurium treated with naringenin cDNA was labeled with Cy3 and control cDNA labeled with Cy5 were mixed and applied to three slides while the labeling was reversed for remaining three slides. This strategy was used to avoid any bias arising due to dye labeling activity of Cy3 versus Cy5. The labeled mixtures were cleaned again using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Equal amounts of labeled cDNA from  S. Typhimurium treatment and control were used to hybridize on the microarray slides. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 18 h in the dark.

Total RNA (10 µg) from treatment and control was used to synthesis cDNA using random primer for reverse transcription (Invitrogen Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The primer was annealed at 70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in a dry ice-ethanol bath for 30 s and then centrifugation for 1 min. The reaction mixture (Superscript III buffer, 0.1 M dithiothreitol, and Aminoallyl-deoxyuridine triphosphate mix) was then incubated with Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified cDNAs were labeled with Cy-3 mono-Reactive Dye and Cy-5 mono-Reactive Dye (GE Health Care)

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A total of six slides were used. S. Typhimurium treated with naringenin cDNA was labeled with Cy3 and control cDNA labeled with Cy5 were mixed and applied to three slides while the labeling was reversed for remaining three slides. This strategy was used to avoid any bias arising due to dye labeling activity of Cy3 versus Cy5. The labeled mixtures were cleaned again using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Equal amounts of labeled cDNA from  S. Typhimurium treatment and control were used to hybridize on the microarray slides. Hybridization was carried out at 42°C for 18 h in the dark.

    <Summary>
Salmonellosis is one of the leading health problems worldwide. With the rise of drug resistance strains it has become imperative to identify alternative strategies. Naringenin, a flavonone, is present predominantly in grapefruit. Previously we have demonstrated that naringenin is potent inhibitor of cell-cell signaling. In the present study, we provide evidence that naringenin specifically represses 24 genes in the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1, and down-regulates 17 genes involved in flagellar and motility; thereby, attenuating virulence and cell motility, respectively. This is the first molecular evidence to demonstrate effect of naringenin on bacterial virulence and cell motility.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
One condition experiment, naringenin treated versus DMSO treated. Biological replicates: 3 control, 3 treatment, hybridized in dye-swapped design
