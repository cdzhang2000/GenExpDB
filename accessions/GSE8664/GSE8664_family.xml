H37Rv (wild type)
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (GIBCOy BRL) and transferred to 2-ml screw-cap tubes containing 0.4-ml of 0.1-mm diameter zirconiaysilica beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All the experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivatives obtained during this study. Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml. Sucrose selection was performed on 7H10 plates with 8% sucrose.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described. Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step.

Biological replicate 1 of 3. Comparison between H37Rv (wild type) and sigE mutant. Cell culture untreated.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

Biological replicate 3 of 3. Comparison between H37Rv (wild type) and sigE mutant. Cell culture untreated.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

All the experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivatives obtained during this study. Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

      <Growth-Protocol>
All the experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivatives obtained during this study. Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml. Sucrose selection was performed on 7H10 plates with 8% sucrose.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described. Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

All steps in the MTB DNA microarray gene expression analysis were performed as described. Controls for array quality were printed onto each slide and included a dilution series of MTB genomic DNA (positive control) and salmon sperm DNA (negative control). Additionally, DNA prelabeled with the cyanine dyes Cy3 or Cy5 were printed to ascertain whether spot-to-spot carryover contamination had occurred during the printing step.

Biological replicate 2 of 6. Cell culture exposed to 0.05% SDS for 90 minutes. sigE mutant
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

      <Growth-Protocol>
All the experiments were performed with M. tuberculosis H37Rv and its derivatives obtained during this study. Bacteria were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 (liquid medium) or 7H10 (solid medium; Difco) both supplemented with ADN, 0.2% glycerol and 0.05% Tween 80. Liquid cultures were grown in roller bottles at 37 C. Plates were incubated at 37 C in sealed plastic bags. Escherichia coli strain JM109 was grown in Luria broth (LB; Difco) at 37 C in shaking cultures. When required, antibiotics were added at the following concentrations: kanamycin, 20 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; hygromycin, 150 ug/ml for M. tuberculosis or 50 ug/ml for E. coli; ampicillin, 100 ug/ml; streptomycin, 20 ug/ml. Sucrose selection was performed on 7H10 plates with 8% sucrose.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried.

RNA extraction for RTÐPCR experiments was performed as described previously. Briefly, bacteria were thawed on ice, broken with zirconia beads(Biospec Products), extracted twice with phenolÐchloroformÐ isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and then precipitated in ethanol. To remove the chromosomal DNA, samples were treated twice with TRI reagent (Molecular Research Center) according to the manufacturerÕs instructions. RNA extraction for microarray experiments was performed using the following protocol: the frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1ml of Trizol reagent (Gibco BRL) and transferred to 2ml screw cap tubes containing 0.5 ml of 0.1-mm-diameter zirconia/silica beads (BioSpec Products). Cells were disrupted by two 30 s pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After a 5 min incubation at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at maximum speed for 45 s, and the supernatants were transferred to 2ml Heavy Phase Lock Gel I tubes (Eppendorf) containing 300 ul of chloroformÐisoamyl alcohol (24:1), inverted rapidly for 15 s and incubated 2 min. The samples were centrifuged for 5 min, and the aqueous phase was added to 270 ul of isopropanol. After the addition of 270 ul of 0.8M Na citrate-1.2M NaCl, samples were incubated overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged for 5 min and air dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x  buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion) were added, and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA used an RNeasy column (Qiagen).

    <Data-Processing>
The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

    <Title>The Mycobacterium tuberculosis ECF sigma Factor sE: role in global gene expression and survival in macrophages</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE8664</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>11489128</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
In previously published work, we identified three Mycobacterium tuberculosis sigma (s) factor genes responding to heat shock (sigB, sigE and sigH ). Two of them (sigB and sigE ) also responded to SDS exposure. As these responses to stress suggested that the s factors encoded by these genes could be involved in pathogenicity, we are studying their role in physiology and virulence. In this work, we characterize a sigE mutant of M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The sigE mutant strain was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to heat shock, SDS and various oxidative stresses. It was also defective in the ability to grow inside both human and murine unactivated macrophages and was more sensitive than the wild-type strain to the killing activity of activated murine macrophages. Using microarray technology and quantitative reverse transcriptionÐpolymerase chain reaction (RTÐPCR), we started to define the sigmaE regulon of M. tuberculosis and its involvement in the global regulation of the stress induced by SDS. We showed the requirement for a functional sigE gene for full expression of sigB and for its induction after SDS exposure but not after heat shock. We also identified several genes that are no longer induced when sigmaE is absent. These genes encode proteins belonging to different classes including transcriptional regulators, enzymes involved in fatty acid degradation and classical heat shock proteins.
