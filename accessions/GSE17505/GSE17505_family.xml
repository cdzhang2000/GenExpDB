      <Treatment-Protocol>
One set of fermentations were exposed to 5 mM IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time. One set of fermentations were exposed to IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time. One set of fermentations were exposed to IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
One set of fermentations were exposed to 5 mM IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time. One set of fermentations were exposed to IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

    <Summary>
The transcriptome profiles for wild-type (plasmid-free) and recombinant (plasmid-bearing) Escherichia coli during well-controlled synchronized high-cell-density fed-batch cultures were analyzed by DNA microarrays. It was observed that the growth phase significantly affected the transcriptome profiles, and the transcriptome profiles were significantly different for the recombinant and wild-type cultures. The response of the wild-type and recombinant cultures to an isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside- (IPTG-) addition was examined, where IPTG induced recombinant protein production in the plasmid-bearing cultures. The IPTG-addition significantly altered the transcriptome response of the wild-type cultures entering the stationary phase. The IPTG-induced recombinant protein production resulted in a significant down-regulation of many energy synthesis genes (atp, nuo, cyo), as well as nearly all transcription- and translation-related genes (rpo, rpl, rpm, rps, rrf, rrl, rrs). Numerous phage (psp, hfl) and transposon-related genes (tra, ins) were significantly regulated in the recombinant cultures due to the IPTG-induction. These results indicate that the signaling mechanism, associated with the recombinant protein production, may induce a metabolic burden in the form of a phage defense mechanism. Taken together, these results indicated that recombinant protein production initiated a cascade of transcriptome responses that down-regulated the very genes needed to sustain productivity.
In this study, the transcriptome profiles for recombinant and wild-type E. coli cultures were compared. The recombinant and wild-type cultures were monitored during the exponential growth phase and as the cultures entered the stationary phase. Well-controlled fed-batch fermenters were used to synchronize the high-cell density cultures. E. coli MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] and E. coli MG1655 (plasmid-free) were exposed to IPTG in the exponential phase, where chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) expression was induced in the plasmid-bearing cultures. Control cultures, not exposed to IPTG, were also examined. The gene expression profiles were determined using DNA microarrays. Recombinant protein production was shown to result in a metabolic burden due to significant down-regulation of the transcription, translation, and energy synthesis genes.  This was the first comprehensive study that has examined the transcriptome of wild-type and recombinant cultures under the same set of conditions.  This data indicated that one cannot merely extrapolate the behavior of recombinant cultures from wild-type culture data.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
All fermentations were synchronized in time to the time at which the cell density reached approximately 11.5 OD, or roughly 70% of the fermenter’s maximum cell density. IPTG (5 mM) was added when the cell density reached the targeted OD for the cultures to be induced. Cells were harvested at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hours relative to the synchronization time point (identified as Time S0, S1, etc). Each fermentation condition was conducted in duplicate. For the recombinant Control Time S0 sample, triplicate samples were available since prior to the IPTG-addition, all fermentations within a strain were replicates. All fermentation conditions were repeated twice (two biological replicates). RNA from each biological replicate was purified and processed independently. Three biological replicates were obtained from for the recombinant Control sample (Time S0) since the cultures prior to the IPTG-addition were replicates. Prior to hybridization, where only two biological replicates existed, one of the RNA samples was divided into two technical replicates, resulting in three separate hybridized chips. The wild-type Time S0 samples and all Time S1 and S4 samples contained data from three DNA microarrays obtained from two biological duplicates (30 DNA microarrays total).
