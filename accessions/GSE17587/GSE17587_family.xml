      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures were grown in standard 7H9 broth media until a desired OD600 of 0.4-0.6 was reached.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was fixed by treating the samples with RNAlater,and later extracted using RNAbee (Tel-test Inc).  Samples underwent phenol/chloroform extraction and isopropanol precipitation.  For clean up, samples were DNAse treated and purified using an RNeasy Kit (Qiagen).

      <Label-Protocol>
8 ug of total RNA was primed with random decamers, then reverse transcribed for 2h at 50C using 400 U SuperScript III RTase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 10 mM each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP, 2 mM dCTP, and 1 mM Cy3/Cy5 dCTP.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide) was added, and samples were hybridized using a Tecan HS 400 Pro hybridization station.  Slides were pre-hybridized (1% BSA, 0.1% SDS, 4x SSC) for 45min. Slides were washed sequentially using 2x SSC 0.1% SDS, 1x SSC, 0.2x SSC, and 0.05x SSC.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Images were scanned using a GenePix 2500 scanner.

    <Description>
Analysis used wild-type RNA as a control to compare against RNA obtained from pepD deletion strain
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Scanned images were processed and normalized using Scanalyze software.  Data output was processed using MS Excel and SAM.

    <Summary>
pepD is regulated by a 2CS, MprAB, and impacts upon the regulation of sigE, an important M.tb sigma factor.  Here we examine the global impact of gene regulation in a delta pepD mutant strain.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Analysis compares total RNA from early log growth cultures of both wild-type and a delta pepD strain.
