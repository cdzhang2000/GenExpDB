Slides were cross-linked in a Stratalinker (Stratagene), using the “auto-link” function at 3000ujoulesx100. Prior to hybridization, slides were pre-hybridized for 2 hours at room temperature in 0.2% SDS then rinsed in filtered water (10 sec) then in 70%.EtOH (5sec). Slides were dried by centrifugation at 1000rpm for 3 min.

    <Summary>
Transcriptional profiling of Mycobacterium smegmatis comparing strains undergoing I-SceI generated DNA damage at a single genomic locus
Gene designations are the updated annotation
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Four comparisons were made, all with log phase cultures and no ATc added. Darr Site(+) with an empty vector compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+), Darr Site(+) with a vector expressing WT Arr compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+), Darr Site(+) with a vector expressing ArrH18A compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+), Darr Site(+) with a vector expressing Arr D83A compared to wild-type M. smegmatis Site(+). 3 biological replicates of each strain for each experiment.
