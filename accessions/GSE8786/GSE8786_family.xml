      <Growth-Protocol>
The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 1 of 6. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 4 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 4 of 6. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 4 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 1 of 3. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 6 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 3 of 3. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 6 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

Frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (GIBCOy BRL) and transferred to 2-ml screw-cap tubes containing 0.4-ml of 0.1-mm diameter zirconiaysilica beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 3 of 3. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 8 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (GIBCOy BRL) and transferred to 2-ml screw-cap tubes containing 0.4-ml of 0.1-mm diameter zirconiaysilica beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 3 of 3. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 10 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 3 of 3. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 12 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 3 of 9. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 14 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 6 of 9. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 14 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 8 of 9. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 14 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

Frozen cell pellets were suspended in 1 ml of Trizol reagent (GIBCOy BRL) and transferred to 2-ml screw-cap tubes containing 0.4-ml of 0.1-mm diameter zirconiaysilica beads (BioSpec Products, Bartlesville, OK).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set (Qiagen)) was used. Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 1.5 ug of total RNA and 4.4 mg of random oligonucleotide hexamers were incubated 2 min at 98C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5mM dA,G,CTP, 0.02mM dTTP, 1.5 nmol Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham), and 1.8 ml Stratascript RTase (Stratagene) (in a total volume of 25 ul). This mixture was incubated 10 min at 25 C and 90 min at 42 C. cDNA was purified by microcon-10 (Amicon) filtration.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 2 of 2. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 20 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 1 of 5. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 80 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

The following conditions have been routinely used for in vitro experiments in our laboratories and were used here to establish a baseline expression profile for M. tuberculosis in the stationary phase experiments. Cultures of M. tuberculosis clinical isolate 1254 were started at an optical density (OD) of 0.15. Cells were grown below an OD of 0.3 for at least 1-week prior to the start of an experiment. The cultures were grown in 30 ml 7H9 medium (supplemented with bovine serum albumin, NaCl, glucose, and glycerol) in 250-ml vented tissue culture flasks and shaking at 90 rpm. Entire flasks were sampled at the given number of days after the start of the experiment. The NRP experiments were conducted as described by Wayne and Hayes. Briefly, laboratory strain H37Rv was inoculated at a starting OD of 0.004 in 20 125mm test tubes containing 8-mm stir bars. The test tube tops were sealed with silicone and stirred at 120 rpm at 37 C. The contents of two test tubes were used for each time point assayed. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation for 4 min and frozen on dry ice.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide microarrays were first prehybridized for 1 h in 5X SSC, 1% BSA and 0.1% SDS and washed with H2O and isopropanol. Following the prehybridization, 10 ul hybridization solution (labeled cDNA, 5 mg tRNA, 2X SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized overnight at 54 C.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using ScanAlyze (Michael Eisen, http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm). Before scanning the microarrays for this project we first scanned a control microarray (day 0) to set the gain for the Cy3 and Cy5 channels, and then scanned the stationary phase and NRP experiments without changing the gain values. The microarray intensity values were not normalized after scanning.

Biological replicate 4 of 5. Experiment grew under respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted (Wayne Growth) for 80 days.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
We eliminated large fluctuations in ratios, due to very low values in spots with near zero signal intensity in one channel, by adjusting the low value in these spots to a minimum noise value. The noise value for each channel was determined by calculating the average intensity value for the 20% lowest intensity spots, and then every value below this average noise value was raised to the noise value. Data processing value is Log (base 2) of the ratio of the mean of Channel 2 (usually 635 nm) to Channel 1 (usually 532 nm).

    <Title>Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene expression during adaptation to stationary phase and low-oxygen dormancy</Title>

    <Summary>
The innate mechanisms used by Mycobacterium tuberculosis to persist during periods of non-proliferation are central to understanding the physiology of the bacilli during latent disease. We have used whole genome expression profiling to expose adaptive mechanisms initiated by M. tuberculosis in two common models of M. tuberculosis non-proliferation. The first of these models was a standard growth curve in which gene expression changes were followed from exponential growth through the transition to stationary phase. In the second model, we followed the adaptive process of M. tuberculosis during transition from aerobic growth to a state of anaerobic non-replicating persistence. The most striking finding from these experiments was the strong induction of the entire DosR dormancy regulon over approximately 20 days during the long transition to an anaerobic state. This is contrasted by the muted overall response to aerated stationary phase with only a partial dormancy regulon response. From the results presented here we conclude that the respiration-limited environment of the oxygen-depleted NRP model recreates at least one fundamental factor for which the genome of M. tuberculosis encodes a decisive adaptive program.
