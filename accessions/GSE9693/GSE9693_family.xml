Oligonucleotides of 55 to 70 bp with a matched melting temperature of ~60 C were designed to be specific for each gene. The probes (70 mer) were synthesized (Operon) and suspended in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide and spotted as triplicates onto Corning UltraGAPS slides using a custom-built microarrayer and Telechem 946 pins at the Cornell University Microarray Core Facility (www.bigredspots.cornell.edu). Autoblank (buffer without oligos) was used as a negative control. The slides were processed according to the slide manufacturer’s instructions, using hydration and UV irradiation, and stored in a dark, dust-free environment.

    <Description>
The genome sequences of C. difficile 630 and QCD-32g58 were used as a source of the genes used in this study. The final arrays consisted of 13,824 spots corresponding to 4227 coding sequences present in both or either strains, with many genes represented by multiple spots. Genes that lacked unique regions were excluded (126 genes from the strain 630 and 34 genes from the strain QCD-32g58).

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Comparative Genomic Hybridization of Clostridium difficile strain CDC3 (human isolate)
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.).

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Three micrograms of genomic DNA from each strain was fragmented by DraI digestion at 37°C for 3 h and cleaned up with QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Fragmented DNA was then labeled with 10 µg of exo-resistant random primers (Fermentas), 25 U of Klenow fragment (New England Biolabs), dNTP mix (0.12 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP and 0.03 mM dTTP), and 0.1 mM of either Cy3- or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences). Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

Probes were purified from unincorporated dyes using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Labeled DNA sample yields and dye incorporation efficiencies were determined using spectrometry.

Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

    <Data-Processing>
The Cy3 and Cy5 signals and the local background intensities were quantified using GenePix Pro 6.1 software. The local background value was subtracted from the intensity of each spot. Spots were examined manually, and poor spots were flagged for elimination from the analysis. All subsequent data analyses were performed by using Microsoft Excel and a genomotyping analysis software GACK to determine present/divergent genes.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Genomic DNA from C. difficile 630 was used as a reference DNA for all hybridizations. Dye swaps were performed to test dye-incorporation bias. The microarray slides were prehybridized using a solution containing 25% formamide, 5x SSC (1x SSC consists of 0.15M NaCl with 0.015M sodium citrate), 0.2% (w/v) sarcosyl, and 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin at 42 °C for 1 h. The slides were then washed in MilliQ water and blow dried using compressed nitrogen gas. Equivalent amounts of labeled probes from reference and tested strains were pooled, lyophilized, and resuspended in 70 µl of hybridization buffer (25% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA, and 1 mg/ml yeast tRNA). The probes were then denatured at 99 °C for 5 min, centrifuged briefly at 13,800 x g and applied to the microarray under a 22 x 60mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C for 16 h in a sealed humidified hybridization chamber (Corning). Following the hybridization, excess hybridization solution and unbound probes were washed away during four washing steps including 5 min in 2x SSC, 1% SDS at 42 °C and 5 min in 0.1% SSC at room temperature for three times. The slides were then dried and scanned immediately.

    <Summary>
Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive, spore-forming enteric anaerobe which can infect humans and a wide variety of animal species. Recently, the incidence and severity of human C. difficile infection has markedly increased. In this study, we evaluated the genomic content of 73 C. difficile strains isolated from humans, horses, cattle, and pigs by comparative genomic hybridization with microarrays containing coding sequences from C. difficile strains 630 and QCD-32g58. The sequenced genome of C. difficile strain 630 was used as a reference to define a candidate core genome of C. difficile and to explore correlations between host origins and genetic diversity. Approximately 16% of the genes in strain 630 were highly conserved among all strains, representing the core complement of functional genes defining C. difficile. Absent or divergent genes in the tested strains were distributed across the entire C. difficile 630 genome and across all the predicted functional categories. Interestingly, certain genes were conserved among strains from a specific host species, but divergent in isolates with other host origins. This information provides insight into the genomic changes which might contribute to host adaptation. Due to a high degree of divergence among C. difficile strains, a core gene list from this study offers the first step toward the construction of diagnostic arrays for C. difficile.
