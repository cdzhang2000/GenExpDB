    <Description>
DNA microarray slides were scanned by using the Genepix® 4000B Microarray scanner. Image analyses of scanned microarrays were performed using GenePix® Pro 5.0. (Axon). Images were visually inspected and spots affected by irregularities were flagged manually. Resulting data were filtered according to the following criteria: (a) removal of flagged spots (b) removal of spots with diameter &lt;70 μm (average spot size on arrays is 120 μm), and (c) removal of spots with (% pixels 532 nm &gt; background + 1 standard deviation) + (% pixels 635 nm &gt; background + 1 standard deviation) &lt; 100. For the remaining values, log2 transformations were applied, and linear normalizations were used to correct the parameter “median of ratios” to median = 0. For each series a two-tailed t-test was performed on the data from one dye combination (e.g. control cDNA were labeled Cy5 and cDNA from the TPEN stressed cells were labeled Cy3) and the corresponding dye-swap experiments (e.g. control cDNA were labeled Cy3 and and cDNA from the TPEN stressed cells were labeled Cy5).

    <Summary>
DNA microarrays were used to probe the transcriptional response of E. coli to N,N,N',N'-tetrakis(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). Fifty-five transcripts were significantly up-regulated including all of the genes that are regulated by Zur and many genes regulated by Fur.  In these same TPEN-treated cells, forty-six transcripts were significantly down-regulated.  
Keywords: E. coli, TPEN, zinc 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
To identify genes that are differentially-expressed in response to TPEN, E. coli BL21(DE3) cells grown in minimal medium until the cultures reached mid-log phase.  TPEN was introduced and the cells were cultured for 5 hours; this time was chosen so that the results would correspond to previous transcriptional response studies with excess Zn(II). The cultures containing 5 uM TPEN were analyzed with DNA microarrays (E. coli K12 V2 array slides from MWG-BIOTECH), and the results were compared to those from E. coli cells grown in minimal medium containing no TPEN. A minimum of six slides was used for each experiment (3 slides with one combination of Cy3 and Cy5 dyes and 3 slides with swapped dyes).
