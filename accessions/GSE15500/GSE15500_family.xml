    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

A small amount of frozen stock was inoculated into a flask of glycerol (2g/L) M9 minimal media and incubated at 30 degrees C.  After the culture reached stationary phase, it was diluted 1:100 into three separate flasks containing glycerol minimal media -- again these were incubated @ 30 degrees C.  These cultures were the three replicates used to extract mRNA for hybridization to the GeneChips.  mRNA was extracted when the cultures reached an OD of 0.3 (mid-log phase)

Approximately 10 ug of total RNA extract was used for cDNA synthesis (SuperScript II).  RNA was then removed by addition of NaOH and heat.  cDNA was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification kit and then fragmented using DNase I.  Fragments were visualized on a 2% agarose gel to confirm most fragments were 50-200 bp.  cDNA was 3'-terminal labeled using the GeneChip DNA Labeling Reagent.

    <Description>
The purpose of the experiment was to observe gene expression differences in mid-log phase growth of E. coli K-12 in glycerol M9 minimal media resulting from certain RNA polymerase (rpoC) mutations which had appeared during adaptive evolution in glycerol M9 minimal media.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The twelve .cel files representing the expression measurements for triplicates of wild-type E. coli K-12 MG1655 and three related RNAP mutants were normalized together using RMAExpress and written to file using log-scale.  Gene names were assigned to results by mapping the gene probe ID to annotation using the Probe Set Data provided by Affymetrix.  Only probes which mapped to a gene synonym (three or four letters, such as hfq or rpoC) or a Blattner number (a &quot;b&quot; followed by a four-digit number, such as b1234) were considered in further analysis.  There were 4070 such probes.  Therefore, the VALUEs in the processed file are RMA-normalized log-scale values for the signal of probes on the GeneChip that corresponded to a gene synonym or Blattner number in the Probe Set Data file.

Approximately 10 ug of total RNA extract was used for cDNA synthesis (SuperScript II).  RNA was then removed by addition of NaOH and heat.  cDNA was purified using QIAquick PCR Purification kit and then fragmented using DNase I.  Fragments were visualized on a 2% agarose gel to confirm most fragments were 50-200 bp.  cDNA was 3'-terminal labeled using the GeneChip DNA Labeling Reagent.

    <Description>
The purpose of the experiment was to observe gene expression differences in mid-log phase growth of E. coli K-12 in glycerol M9 minimal media resulting from certain RNA polymerase (rpoC) mutations which had appeared during adaptive evolution in glycerol M9 minimal media.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The twelve .cel files representing the expression measurements for triplicates of wild-type E. coli K-12 MG1655 and three related RNAP mutants were normalized together using RMAExpress and written to file using log-scale.  Gene names were assigned to results by mapping the gene probe ID to annotation using the Probe Set Data provided by Affymetrix.  Only probes which mapped to a gene synonym (three or four letters, such as hfq or rpoC) or a Blattner number (a &quot;b&quot; followed by a four-digit number, such as b1234) were considered in further analysis.  There were 4070 such probes.  Therefore, the VALUEs in the processed file are RMA-normalized log-scale values for the signal of probes on the GeneChip that corresponded to a gene synonym or Blattner number in the Probe Set Data file.

A small amount of frozen stock was inoculated into a flask of glycerol (2g/L) M9 minimal media and incubated at 30 degrees C.  After the culture reached stationary phase, it was diluted 1:100 into three separate flasks containing glycerol minimal media -- again these were incubated @ 30 degrees C.  These cultures were the three replicates used to extract mRNA for hybridization to the GeneChips.  mRNA was extracted when the cultures reached an OD of 0.3 (mid-log phase)

A small amount of frozen stock was inoculated into a flask of glycerol (2g/L) M9 minimal media and incubated at 30 degrees C.  After the culture reached stationary phase, it was diluted 1:100 into three separate flasks containing glycerol minimal media -- again these were incubated @ 30 degrees C.  These cultures were the three replicates used to extract mRNA for hybridization to the GeneChips.  mRNA was extracted when the cultures reached an OD of 0.3 (mid-log phase)

The purpose of the experiment was to observe gene expression differences in mid-log phase growth of E. coli K-12 in glycerol M9 minimal media resulting from certain RNA polymerase (rpoC) mutations which had appeared during adaptive evolution in glycerol M9 minimal media.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The twelve .cel files representing the expression measurements for triplicates of wild-type E. coli K-12 MG1655 and three related RNAP mutants were normalized together using RMAExpress and written to file using log-scale.  Gene names were assigned to results by mapping the gene probe ID to annotation using the Probe Set Data provided by Affymetrix.  Only probes which mapped to a gene synonym (three or four letters, such as hfq or rpoC) or a Blattner number (a &quot;b&quot; followed by a four-digit number, such as b1234) were considered in further analysis.  There were 4070 such probes.  Therefore, the VALUEs in the processed file are RMA-normalized log-scale values for the signal of probes on the GeneChip that corresponded to a gene synonym or Blattner number in the Probe Set Data file.

    <Title>Analysis of differences in gene expression due to small adaptive mutations in RNA polymerase B' subunit (rpoC)</Title>

    <Summary>
Studies of the RNA polymerase-binding molecule ppGpp in bacteria and plants have shown that changes to the kinetics of the RNA polymerase can have dramatic biological effects in the short-term as a stress response.  Here we describe the reprogramming of the kinetic parameters of the RNAP through mutations arising during laboratory adaptive evolution of Escherichia coli in minimal media.  The mutations cause a 10- to 30-fold decrease in open complex stability at a ribosomal promoter and approximately a 10-fold decrease in transcriptional pausing in the his operon.  The kinetic changes coincide with large scale transcriptional changes, including strong downregulation of motility, acid-resistance, fimbria, and curlin genes which are observed in site-directed mutants containing the RNA polymerase mutations as well as the evolved strains harboring the mutations.  Site-directed mutants also grow 60% faster than the parent strain and convert the carbon-source 15% to 35% more efficiently to biomass.  The results show that long-term adjustment of the kinetic parameters of RNA polymerase through mutation can be important for adaptation to a condition.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Mutations in the RNA polymerase beta prime subunit (rpoC) were discovered in E. coli following adaptation to continual logarithmic growth (OD &lt;= 0.3) in glycerol M9 minimal media at 30 C.  We used site-directed mutagenesis to make strains of E. coli isogenic to wild-type except for single adaptive rpoC mutations.  We found they increase growth rate in this condition by 60%.  In order to understand how the mutations affect gene expression in this condition, we extracted total mRNA from the strains, which had been growing in the adaptive evolution condition, at OD=0.3.  There were three RNAP mutants and the wild-type (E. coli K-12 MG1655).  Each strain had three flasks from which RNA was extracted (three biological replicates).  There were no technical replicates.  The mRNA was synthesized into cDNA, labeled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli 2.0 GeneChip.
