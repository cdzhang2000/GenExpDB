    <Description>
Total RNA was isolated by CsCl2 method and labeled cDNA was generated using the Fairplay microarray labelling kit from Stratagene using random hexamers.  Labeled cDNA was purified using QiaQuick PCR purification columns from Qiagen and concentrated using Microcon YM30 columns from Amicon.  The amount of incorporated label was determined by measuring the absorbance at 550nm (Cy3) or 650nm (Cy5). 60 pmol each of Cy-dye (reference cDNA (Cy5) and test cDNA (Cy3)) were combined in 60 ml hybridization buffer 1 (Ambion), denatured and hybridized to the array at 42Â°C for at least 16 h, followed by subsequent washes.  Output data (F635 mean-B635, F532 mean-B532, flags) was filtered to set any spots that did not exceed 2SD above a background threshold to the threshold value to avoid spurious expression ratios. Remaining spots were averaged, filtered to remove genes not present in MGAS315 (the strain examined) and normalized before statistical analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Growth phase specific normalization after removing genes not present in MGAS315.
Condition-specific normalization:
Following data filtration and ratio of signal calculations, the data from each array was adjusted and normalized so that valid comparisons could be made between experiments. Because the total level of transcript in the conditions being compared (stationary vs. exponential phase) was not similar, we compared the relative abundance of the transcript in one phase to its relative abundance in the other phase using two normalization steps.  First, an average for the total signal of the six arrays from each growth phase was calculated (1256 was the average in exponential phase and 389 was the average in stationary phase).  To correct for signal variations between replicate arrays, the value for each gene was adjusted by a factor so that the total signal for each array was equal to the average for the six in that growth phase. Second, the value for each gene adjusted for differences between replicates was divided by the average total signal in exponential phase. Normalized data was then log2 transformed, and statistical analysis and fold changes in expression in stationary phase versus exponential phase were obtained using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software

Following data filtration and ratio of signal calculations, the data from each array was adjusted and normalized so that valid comparisons could be made between experiments. Because the total level of transcript in the conditions being compared (stationary vs. exponential phase) was not similar, we compared the relative abundance of the transcript in one phase to its relative abundance in the other phase using two normalization steps.  First, an average for the total signal of the six arrays from each growth phase was calculated (1256 was the average in exponential phase and 389 was the average in stationary phase).  To correct for signal variations between replicate arrays, the value for each gene was adjusted by a factor so that the total signal for each array was equal to the average for the six in that growth phase. Second, the value for each gene adjusted for differences between replicates was divided by the average total signal in exponential phase. Normalized data was then log2 transformed, and statistical analysis and fold changes in expression in stationary phase versus exponential phase were obtained using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software

    <Description>
Total RNA was isolated by CsCl2 method and labeled cDNA was generated using the Fairplay microarray labelling kit from Stratagene using random hexamers.  Labeled cDNA was purified using QiaQuick PCR purification columns from Qiagen and concentrated using Microcon YM30 columns from Amicon.  The amount of incorporated label was determined by measuring the absorbance at 550nm (Cy3) or 650nm (Cy5). 60 pmol each of Cy-dye (reference cDNA (Cy5) and test cDNA (Cy3)) were combined in 60 ml hybridization buffer 1 (Ambion), denatured and hybridized to the array at 42ï¿½C for at least 16 h, followed by subsequent washes.  Output data (F635 mean-B635, F532 mean-B532, flags) was filtered to set any spots that did not exceed 2SD above a background threshold to the threshold value to avoid spurious expression ratios. Remaining spots were averaged, filtered to remove genes not present in MGAS315 (the strain examined) and normalized before statistical analysis.

Growth phase specific normalization after removing genes not present in MGAS315.
Condition-specific normalization:
Following data filtration and ratio of signal calculations, the data from each array was adjusted and normalized so that valid comparisons could be made between experiments. Because the total level of transcript in the conditions being compared (stationary vs. exponential phase) was not similar, we compared the relative abundance of the transcript in one phase to its relative abundance in the other phase using two normalization steps.  First, an average for the total signal of the six arrays from each growth phase was calculated (1256 was the average in exponential phase and 389 was the average in stationary phase).  To correct for signal variations between replicate arrays, the value for each gene was adjusted by a factor so that the total signal for each array was equal to the average for the six in that growth phase. Second, the value for each gene adjusted for differences between replicates was divided by the average total signal in exponential phase. Normalized data was then log2 transformed, and statistical analysis and fold changes in expression in stationary phase versus exponential phase were obtained using Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) software

    <Description>
Total RNA was isolated by CsCl2 method and labeled cDNA was generated using the Fairplay microarray labelling kit from Stratagene using random hexamers.  Labeled cDNA was purified using QiaQuick PCR purification columns from Qiagen and concentrated using Microcon YM30 columns from Amicon.  The amount of incorporated label was determined by measuring the absorbance at 550nm (Cy3) or 650nm (Cy5). 60 pmol each of Cy-dye (reference cDNA (Cy5) and test cDNA (Cy3)) were combined in 60 ml hybridization buffer 1 (Ambion), denatured and hybridized to the array at 42ï¿½C for at least 16 h, followed by subsequent washes.  Output data (F635 mean-B635, F532 mean-B532, flags) was filtered to set any spots that did not exceed 2SD above a background threshold to the threshold value to avoid spurious expression ratios. Remaining spots were averaged, filtered to remove genes not present in MGAS315 (the strain examined) and normalized before statistical analysis.
