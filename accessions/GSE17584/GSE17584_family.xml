    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Four different conditions were tested in this study: W3110 in LB medium (WT), W3110 in LB+glucose medium (WT G), PC05 in LB medium (CRP*), and PC05 in LB+glucose medium (CRP* G).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cells grown for harvesting were prepared briefly as follows.  Overnight pre-seed cultures were prepared by inoculating 3 ml of LB medium (in 13 x 100 mm tube) with a few colonies from a fresh LB plate. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate, to an OD600 of 0.1, 50 ml LB media (with or without 0.4% glucose supplementation) seed cultures in a 250 ml shake-flask. The seed culture were grown at 37Â°C to an OD600 of ~2 and then were used to directly inoculate, to an OD600 of 0.02, 100 ml LB media (with or without 0.4% glucose supplementation) cultures in a 500 ml flask. These cultures were grown at 37Â°C and 250 rpm to an OD600 of 0.5.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Cells from the 100 ml culture were harvested at an OD600 of 0.5 (early logarithmic growth phase) by immediately placing on ice, transferring to 50 ml falcon tubes and centrifuging at 4oC for 5 minutes before treating with lysozyme. Promega PureYieldTM RNA Midiprep System kit was used for RNA extraction. As a preliminary check, RNA yield and quality were determined by spectrophotometry according to the manufacturerâs protocol and the integrity of the purified RNA was determined by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis.
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and total RNA integrity was examined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Total RNA of sufficient concentration, purity, and integrity was labeled and subsequently hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays by the Penn State DNA Microarray Facility according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 ug of total RNA was converted to cDNA using random primed reverse transcription. cDNA was purified by removing the RNA via hydrolysis with NaOH and then neutralizing the solution. Purified cDNA was fragmented and subsequently end-labeled with biotin.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Fragmented, end-labeled cDNA was dissolved in hybridization cocktail and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays (approximately 10000 probe set) for 16 hours at 45oC. The details of GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays are described by Affymetrix.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
After hybridization, the hybridization cocktail was removed and the arrays were washed to remove unbound and non-specifically bound cDNA. Hybridization was detected by staining the arrays with streptavidin phycoerythrin. All washing and staining was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Stained arrays were scanned using the Affymetrix GCS3000 7G scanner.

CRP LB+Glucose, Biological Rep1
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
A minimum of three data sets was generated for each of the four different conditions tested (based on the combination of the strains W3110 and PC05 in LB and LB+glucose media). Affymetrix Expression ConsoleTM software (Version 1.1) was used for background adjustment, normalization and summarization of chip level data in the form of feature intensity (CEL) files in order to generate probe set summarization (CHP) files, using the probe logarithmic intensity error (PLIER) method. Data from CHP files were then exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. Signal values for 10208 probsets from GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays were filtered to extract probe set data for only the E. coli K-12 strain. All calculations and analyses were performed on the 4070 genes remaining after filtration.  Signal values were transformed to the log base for the pair-wise comparisons. A linear model was fitted to each gene using the Bioconductor software package LIMMA in the R environment. The linear model coefficients were used to calculate significant differences in expression levels for all pair-wise comparisons. The P-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method and genes with a P-value of &lt;0.05 were considered as those with significantly different expression levels under different conditions tested. Data are reported as expression levels (signal values) or ratios of expression levels. Written code in R (file name: code.doc) can be found in supplementary material (http://www.che.psu.edu/Faculty/Cirino). Gene Annotations were transformed from AFFY probe set IDâs to Entrez gene IDs using NETAFFX on the Affymetrix website. The online database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) were used for pathway visualization and gene ontology (GO) classification.

    <Data-Processing>
A minimum of three data sets was generated for each of the four different conditions tested (based on the combination of the strains W3110 and PC05 in LB and LB+glucose media). Affymetrix Expression ConsoleTM software (Version 1.1) was used for background adjustment, normalization and summarization of chip level data in the form of feature intensity (CEL) files in order to generate probe set summarization (CHP) files, using the probe logarithmic intensity error (PLIER) method. Data from CHP files were then exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. Signal values for 10208 probsets from GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays were filtered to extract probe set data for only the E. coli K-12 strain. All calculations and analyses were performed on the 4070 genes remaining after filtration.  Signal values were transformed to the log base for the pair-wise comparisons. A linear model was fitted to each gene using the Bioconductor software package LIMMA in the R environment. The linear model coefficients were used to calculate significant differences in expression levels for all pair-wise comparisons. The P-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method and genes with a P-value of &lt;0.05 were considered as those with significantly different expression levels under different conditions tested. Data are reported as expression levels (signal values) or ratios of expression levels. Written code in R (file name: code.doc) can be found in supplementary material (http://www.che.psu.edu/Faculty/Cirino). Gene Annotations were transformed from AFFY probe set IDâs to Entrez gene IDs using NETAFFX on the Affymetrix website. The online database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) were used for pathway visualization and gene ontology (GO) classification.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Four different conditions were tested in this study: W3110 in LB medium (WT), W3110 in LB+glucose medium (WT G), PC05 in LB medium (CRP*), and PC05 in LB+glucose medium (CRP* G).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cells grown for harvesting were prepared briefly as follows.  Overnight pre-seed cultures were prepared by inoculating 3 ml of LB medium (in 13 x 100 mm tube) with a few colonies from a fresh LB plate. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate, to an OD600 of 0.1, 50 ml LB media (with or without 0.4% glucose supplementation) seed cultures in a 250 ml shake-flask. The seed culture were grown at 37Â°C to an OD600 of ~2 and then were used to directly inoculate, to an OD600 of 0.02, 100 ml LB media (with or without 0.4% glucose supplementation) cultures in a 500 ml flask. These cultures were grown at 37Â°C and 250 rpm to an OD600 of 0.5.

Cells from the 100 ml culture were harvested at an OD600 of 0.5 (early logarithmic growth phase) by immediately placing on ice, transferring to 50 ml falcon tubes and centrifuging at 4oC for 5 minutes before treating with lysozyme. Promega PureYieldTM RNA Midiprep System kit was used for RNA extraction. As a preliminary check, RNA yield and quality were determined by spectrophotometry according to the manufacturerâs protocol and the integrity of the purified RNA was determined by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis.

Total RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and total RNA integrity was examined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Total RNA of sufficient concentration, purity, and integrity was labeled and subsequently hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays by the Penn State DNA Microarray Facility according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 ug of total RNA was converted to cDNA using random primed reverse transcription. cDNA was purified by removing the RNA via hydrolysis with NaOH and then neutralizing the solution. Purified cDNA was fragmented and subsequently end-labeled with biotin.

After hybridization, the hybridization cocktail was removed and the arrays were washed to remove unbound and non-specifically bound cDNA. Hybridization was detected by staining the arrays with streptavidin phycoerythrin. All washing and staining was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA).

    <Data-Processing>
A minimum of three data sets was generated for each of the four different conditions tested (based on the combination of the strains W3110 and PC05 in LB and LB+glucose media). Affymetrix Expression ConsoleTM software (Version 1.1) was used for background adjustment, normalization and summarization of chip level data in the form of feature intensity (CEL) files in order to generate probe set summarization (CHP) files, using the probe logarithmic intensity error (PLIER) method. Data from CHP files were then exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. Signal values for 10208 probsets from GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays were filtered to extract probe set data for only the E. coli K-12 strain. All calculations and analyses were performed on the 4070 genes remaining after filtration.  Signal values were transformed to the log base for the pair-wise comparisons. A linear model was fitted to each gene using the Bioconductor software package LIMMA in the R environment. The linear model coefficients were used to calculate significant differences in expression levels for all pair-wise comparisons. The P-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method and genes with a P-value of &lt;0.05 were considered as those with significantly different expression levels under different conditions tested. Data are reported as expression levels (signal values) or ratios of expression levels. Written code in R (file name: code.doc) can be found in supplementary material (http://www.che.psu.edu/Faculty/Cirino). Gene Annotations were transformed from AFFY probe set IDâs to Entrez gene IDs using NETAFFX on the Affymetrix website. The online database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) were used for pathway visualization and gene ontology (GO) classification.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Cells grown for harvesting were prepared briefly as follows.  Overnight pre-seed cultures were prepared by inoculating 3 ml of LB medium (in 13 x 100 mm tube) with a few colonies from a fresh LB plate. The overnight cultures were used to inoculate, to an OD600 of 0.1, 50 ml LB media (with or without 0.4% glucose supplementation) seed cultures in a 250 ml shake-flask. The seed culture were grown at 37Â°C to an OD600 of ~2 and then were used to directly inoculate, to an OD600 of 0.02, 100 ml LB media (with or without 0.4% glucose supplementation) cultures in a 500 ml flask. These cultures were grown at 37Â°C and 250 rpm to an OD600 of 0.5.

The seed culture were grown at 37Â°C to an OD600 of ~2 and then were used to directly inoculate, to an OD600 of 0.02, 100 ml LB media (with or without 0.4% glucose supplementation) cultures in a 500 ml flask. These cultures were grown at 37Â°C and 250 rpm to an OD600 of 0.5.

Cells from the 100 ml culture were harvested at an OD600 of 0.5 (early logarithmic growth phase) by immediately placing on ice, transferring to 50 ml falcon tubes and centrifuging at 4oC for 5 minutes before treating with lysozyme. Promega PureYieldTM RNA Midiprep System kit was used for RNA extraction. As a preliminary check, RNA yield and quality were determined by spectrophotometry according to the manufacturerâs protocol and the integrity of the purified RNA was determined by formaldehyde agarose gel electrophoresis.

Total RNA concentration and purity were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer and total RNA integrity was examined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. Total RNA of sufficient concentration, purity, and integrity was labeled and subsequently hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip microarrays by the Penn State DNA Microarray Facility according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 ug of total RNA was converted to cDNA using random primed reverse transcription. cDNA was purified by removing the RNA via hydrolysis with NaOH and then neutralizing the solution. Purified cDNA was fragmented and subsequently end-labeled with biotin.

Fragmented, end-labeled cDNA was dissolved in hybridization cocktail and hybridized to Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays (approximately 10000 probe set) for 16 hours at 45oC. The details of GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays are described by Affymetrix.

    <Scan-Protocol>
After hybridization, the hybridization cocktail was removed and the arrays were washed to remove unbound and non-specifically bound cDNA. Hybridization was detected by staining the arrays with streptavidin phycoerythrin. All washing and staining was performed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Affymetrix Inc, Santa Clara, CA). Stained arrays were scanned using the Affymetrix GCS3000 7G scanner.

    <Data-Processing>
A minimum of three data sets was generated for each of the four different conditions tested (based on the combination of the strains W3110 and PC05 in LB and LB+glucose media). Affymetrix Expression ConsoleTM software (Version 1.1) was used for background adjustment, normalization and summarization of chip level data in the form of feature intensity (CEL) files in order to generate probe set summarization (CHP) files, using the probe logarithmic intensity error (PLIER) method. Data from CHP files were then exported to a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet for further analysis. Signal values for 10208 probsets from GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays were filtered to extract probe set data for only the E. coli K-12 strain. All calculations and analyses were performed on the 4070 genes remaining after filtration.  Signal values were transformed to the log base for the pair-wise comparisons. A linear model was fitted to each gene using the Bioconductor software package LIMMA in the R environment. The linear model coefficients were used to calculate significant differences in expression levels for all pair-wise comparisons. The P-values were adjusted by the Benjamini-Hochberg method and genes with a P-value of &lt;0.05 were considered as those with significantly different expression levels under different conditions tested. Data are reported as expression levels (signal values) or ratios of expression levels. Written code in R (file name: code.doc) can be found in supplementary material (http://www.che.psu.edu/Faculty/Cirino). Gene Annotations were transformed from AFFY probe set IDâs to Entrez gene IDs using NETAFFX on the Affymetrix website. The online database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery (DAVID) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) were used for pathway visualization and gene ontology (GO) classification.

    <Pubmed-ID>19703305</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Escherichia coli exhibits diauxic growth in sugar mixtures due to CRP-mediated catabolite repression and inducer exclusion related to phosphotransferase system enzyme activity. Replacement of the native crp gene with a catabolite repression mutant (referred to as crp*) alleviates diauxic effects in E. coli and enables co-utilization of glucose and other sugars. While previous studies have examined the effects of expressing CRP* mutants on the expression of specific catabolic genes, little is known about the global transcriptional effects of CRP* expression.
In this study, we compare the transcriptome of E. coli W3110 (expressing wild-type CRP) to that of mutant strain PC05 (expressing CRP*) in the presence and absence of glucose.
