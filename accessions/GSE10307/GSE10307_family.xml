    <Manufacture-Protocol>
Whole genome E. coli K12 DNA-microarrays were printed using the Microgrid II robot of Biorobotics (now Genomic Solutions, Huntingdon, United Kingdom) by spotting oligonucleotides (50mer, dissolved in buffer A; E. coli K-12 V2 Oligo set from MWG, Ebersberg, Germany) representing all E. coli K-12 ORFs on epoxy-coated glass slides (MWG) as duplicates. Oligonucleotides were delivered in 12 384 polypropylene microtiter plates with F-bottom (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany). For details on probe design please see the manufacturer’s protocol (http://ecom2.mwgdna.com/services/array/download.tcl). Tungsten microarray split pins (PT 3000 – Point Technologies, Inc., Colorado, USA) were used for spotting. 27 slides were manufactured per printing process. 3 slides were discarded as so called “pre-spot slides”, 24 slides were used for microarray experiments.
Printing was performed using the following conditions (Software: TAS Application Suite V. 2.6.0.2):
•	Tool: 4x4 configuration
•	Group (Tool Type): 2. Micro Spot (384 Well)
•	Source Action: dwell/remove one lid at a time
•	60 spots / source visit, 10 of them were pre spots
•	soft touch distance: 1.5 mm
•	humidity control: minimal: 58%; target humidity: 63%
•	washing conditions: 3 x at the beginning, 5 x at the end, bath 1 two seconds, bath 2 three seconds (2 mm wiggle); washing solution: ddH2O.
•	all replikates were printed on the first slide first.
After printing, microarrays were incubated in a hybridization oven (Whatman Biometra) at 42°C over night together with a ddH2O filled petri dish covered with looped aluminium foil. Afterwards, microarrays were washed stirring constantly with 0.2 % SDS solution (2 min), two times in ddH2O (1 min) at room temperature and afterwards incubated in the hybridization oven (Whatman Biometra) for 20 min in ddH2O at 50°C. Microarrays were nitrogen dried and stored in a dark and dry place until hybridization.
Quality control: staining with SYBR SafeTM DNA Gel Stain (MolecularProbes) by incubation of the printed area with 750 µL of the solution and incubation for 3 min at room temperature. Arrays were washed four times with 0.5 x TBE-Puffer (5 x stock solution: Tris-Borat 0.45 M; EDTA 0.01 M) and scanned afterwards.
For data analysis, a “gal file” was produced using the software TAS application suite version 2.6.0.2 from Genomic Solutions.

The fed-batch cultivations were carried out with the bacterial strain E. coli K-12 W3110 (DSM 5911, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in a 30-l bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Minimal medium supplemented with glucose as the carbon source was used. The batch medium (batch volume VR,0 =17 l) consisted of 8.8 g l−1 glucose•H2O, 2.0 g l−1 Na2SO4•10H2O, 2.68 g l−1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g l−1 NH4Cl, 14.6 g l−1 K2HPO4, 4.02 g l−1 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 0.01 g l−1 thiamine HCl; 0.3mM CaCl2•2H2O, 2mM MgSO4•7H2O; 3ml l−1 of trace element solution (TES: 16.7 g l−1 FeCl3•6H2O, 20.1 g l−1

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

      <Label-Protocol>
Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The slides were hybridized in the fully automatic hybridization station HS400 (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Labeled cDNA samples were prepared by heating them to 95 °C for 3 min. The hybridization lasted for 12 h at 42 °C. 6 x SSPE (20 x stock: NaCl 175.3 g; NaH2PO4 x 1H2O 27.6 g; Na2EDTA 7.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) was used for pre-wetting; washing buffer 1 (NaCl 17.6 g; sodium citrate 8.8 g; SDS 1 g; ddH2O ad 1 l) and washing buffer 2 (NaCl 0.88 g; NaCitrate 4.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) were used for washing the hybridized slides which were subsequently dried with nitrogen gas for two minutes.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

The culture medium samples were withdrawn with a capillary sampling probe as developed by Theobald et al. (1997), however, without using membrane-covered glass tubes.
The cell samples were collected directly into RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to avoid RNA degradation. The samples were centrifuged according to the manufacturer’s protocol and frozen at - 80 °C until RNA isolation.

The fed-batch cultivations were carried out with the bacterial strain E. coli K-12 W3110 (DSM 5911, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in a 30-l bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Minimal medium supplemented with glucose as the carbon source was used. The batch medium (batch volume VR,0 =17 l) consisted of 8.8 g l−1 glucose•H2O, 2.0 g l−1 Na2SO4•10H2O, 2.68 g l−1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g l−1 NH4Cl, 14.6 g l−1 K2HPO4, 4.02 g l−1 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 0.01 g l−1 thiamine HCl; 0.3mM CaCl2•2H2O, 2mM MgSO4•7H2O; 3ml l−1 of trace element solution (TES: 16.7 g l−1 FeCl3•6H2O, 20.1 g l−1

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The slides were hybridized in the fully automatic hybridization station HS400 (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Labeled cDNA samples were prepared by heating them to 95 °C for 3 min. The hybridization lasted for 12 h at 42 °C. 6 x SSPE (20 x stock: NaCl 175.3 g; NaH2PO4 x 1H2O 27.6 g; Na2EDTA 7.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) was used for pre-wetting; washing buffer 1 (NaCl 17.6 g; sodium citrate 8.8 g; SDS 1 g; ddH2O ad 1 l) and washing buffer 2 (NaCl 0.88 g; NaCitrate 4.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) were used for washing the hybridized slides which were subsequently dried with nitrogen gas for two minutes.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

The culture medium samples were withdrawn with a capillary sampling probe as developed by Theobald et al. (1997), however, without using membrane-covered glass tubes.
The cell samples were collected directly into RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to avoid RNA degradation. The samples were centrifuged according to the manufacturer’s protocol and frozen at - 80 °C until RNA isolation.

The fed-batch cultivations were carried out with the bacterial strain E. coli K-12 W3110 (DSM 5911, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in a 30-l bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Minimal medium supplemented with glucose as the carbon source was used. The batch medium (batch volume VR,0 =17 l) consisted of 8.8 g l−1 glucose•H2O, 2.0 g l−1 Na2SO4•10H2O, 2.68 g l−1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g l−1 NH4Cl, 14.6 g l−1 K2HPO4, 4.02 g l−1 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 0.01 g l−1 thiamine HCl; 0.3mM CaCl2•2H2O, 2mM MgSO4•7H2O; 3ml l−1 of trace element solution (TES: 16.7 g l−1 FeCl3•6H2O, 20.1 g l−1

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The fed-batch cultivations were carried out with the bacterial strain E. coli K-12 W3110 (DSM 5911, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in a 30-l bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Minimal medium supplemented with glucose as the carbon source was used. The batch medium (batch volume VR,0 =17 l) consisted of 8.8 g l−1 glucose•H2O, 2.0 g l−1 Na2SO4•10H2O, 2.68 g l−1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g l−1 NH4Cl, 14.6 g l−1 K2HPO4, 4.02 g l−1 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 0.01 g l−1 thiamine HCl; 0.3mM CaCl2•2H2O, 2mM MgSO4•7H2O; 3ml l−1 of trace element solution (TES: 16.7 g l−1 FeCl3•6H2O, 20.1 g l−1

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The slides were hybridized in the fully automatic hybridization station HS400 (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Labeled cDNA samples were prepared by heating them to 95 °C for 3 min. The hybridization lasted for 12 h at 42 °C. 6 x SSPE (20 x stock: NaCl 175.3 g; NaH2PO4 x 1H2O 27.6 g; Na2EDTA 7.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) was used for pre-wetting; washing buffer 1 (NaCl 17.6 g; sodium citrate 8.8 g; SDS 1 g; ddH2O ad 1 l) and washing buffer 2 (NaCl 0.88 g; NaCitrate 4.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) were used for washing the hybridized slides which were subsequently dried with nitrogen gas for two minutes.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The slides were hybridized in the fully automatic hybridization station HS400 (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Labeled cDNA samples were prepared by heating them to 95 °C for 3 min. The hybridization lasted for 12 h at 42 °C. 6 x SSPE (20 x stock: NaCl 175.3 g; NaH2PO4 x 1H2O 27.6 g; Na2EDTA 7.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) was used for pre-wetting; washing buffer 1 (NaCl 17.6 g; sodium citrate 8.8 g; SDS 1 g; ddH2O ad 1 l) and washing buffer 2 (NaCl 0.88 g; NaCitrate 4.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) were used for washing the hybridized slides which were subsequently dried with nitrogen gas for two minutes.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

The culture medium samples were withdrawn with a capillary sampling probe as developed by Theobald et al. (1997), however, without using membrane-covered glass tubes.
The cell samples were collected directly into RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to avoid RNA degradation. The samples were centrifuged according to the manufacturer’s protocol and frozen at - 80 °C until RNA isolation.

The fed-batch cultivations were carried out with the bacterial strain E. coli K-12 W3110 (DSM 5911, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in a 30-l bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Minimal medium supplemented with glucose as the carbon source was used. The batch medium (batch volume VR,0 =17 l) consisted of 8.8 g l−1 glucose•H2O, 2.0 g l−1 Na2SO4•10H2O, 2.68 g l−1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g l−1 NH4Cl, 14.6 g l−1 K2HPO4, 4.02 g l−1 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 0.01 g l−1 thiamine HCl; 0.3mM CaCl2•2H2O, 2mM MgSO4•7H2O; 3ml l−1 of trace element solution (TES: 16.7 g l−1 FeCl3•6H2O, 20.1 g l−1

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The slides were hybridized in the fully automatic hybridization station HS400 (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Labeled cDNA samples were prepared by heating them to 95 °C for 3 min. The hybridization lasted for 12 h at 42 °C. 6 x SSPE (20 x stock: NaCl 175.3 g; NaH2PO4 x 1H2O 27.6 g; Na2EDTA 7.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) was used for pre-wetting; washing buffer 1 (NaCl 17.6 g; sodium citrate 8.8 g; SDS 1 g; ddH2O ad 1 l) and washing buffer 2 (NaCl 0.88 g; NaCitrate 4.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) were used for washing the hybridized slides which were subsequently dried with nitrogen gas for two minutes.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

The culture medium samples were withdrawn with a capillary sampling probe as developed by Theobald et al. (1997), however, without using membrane-covered glass tubes.
The cell samples were collected directly into RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) to avoid RNA degradation. The samples were centrifuged according to the manufacturer’s protocol and frozen at - 80 °C until RNA isolation.

The fed-batch cultivations were carried out with the bacterial strain E. coli K-12 W3110 (DSM 5911, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in a 30-l bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Minimal medium supplemented with glucose as the carbon source was used. The batch medium (batch volume VR,0 =17 l) consisted of 8.8 g l−1 glucose•H2O, 2.0 g l−1 Na2SO4•10H2O, 2.68 g l−1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g l−1 NH4Cl, 14.6 g l−1 K2HPO4, 4.02 g l−1 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 0.01 g l−1 thiamine HCl; 0.3mM CaCl2•2H2O, 2mM MgSO4•7H2O; 3ml l−1 of trace element solution (TES: 16.7 g l−1 FeCl3•6H2O, 20.1 g l−1

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The fed-batch cultivations were carried out with the bacterial strain E. coli K-12 W3110 (DSM 5911, German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures) in a 30-l bioreactor (Bioengineering AG, Wald, Switzerland). Minimal medium supplemented with glucose as the carbon source was used. The batch medium (batch volume VR,0 =17 l) consisted of 8.8 g l−1 glucose•H2O, 2.0 g l−1 Na2SO4•10H2O, 2.68 g l−1 (NH4)2SO4, 1.0 g l−1 NH4Cl, 14.6 g l−1 K2HPO4, 4.02 g l−1 NaH2PO4•2H2O, 0.01 g l−1 thiamine HCl; 0.3mM CaCl2•2H2O, 2mM MgSO4•7H2O; 3ml l−1 of trace element solution (TES: 16.7 g l−1 FeCl3•6H2O, 20.1 g l−1

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The slides were hybridized in the fully automatic hybridization station HS400 (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Labeled cDNA samples were prepared by heating them to 95 °C for 3 min. The hybridization lasted for 12 h at 42 °C. 6 x SSPE (20 x stock: NaCl 175.3 g; NaH2PO4 x 1H2O 27.6 g; Na2EDTA 7.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) was used for pre-wetting; washing buffer 1 (NaCl 17.6 g; sodium citrate 8.8 g; SDS 1 g; ddH2O ad 1 l) and washing buffer 2 (NaCl 0.88 g; NaCitrate 4.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) were used for washing the hybridized slides which were subsequently dried with nitrogen gas for two minutes.

Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

Total RNA from 8.1*10exp9 cells was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. On-column DNase digestion was performed (RNase free DNase set, Qiagen). RNA concentration and quality were assessed photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., Delaware, USA), by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and bioanalyzer analysis (RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit, Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100, Agilent Technologies, California, USA). Only RNA with 260 nm / 280 nm ratio of 1.8 - 2 as well as 260 nm / 230 nm ratio &gt; 1.8 was used for precipitation. The RNA was precipitated and resolved at the final concentration of 6 µg / µl required for reverse transcription and labeling with fluorescent dyes. Total RNA isolate was mixed with 1/10 volume of NaCl solution (3 M) and 2 volumes of ethanol (100 %) and stored at -20 °C overnight. The samples were subsequently centrifuged (14000 rpm; 20800 g) and the supernatant was discarded. The RNA was washed with ethanol (70 %) and vacuum dried. 100 µg of RNA were used for reverse transcription.

Concentrated total RNA was reverse transcribed using Superscript II RNase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) and labeled at the same time. Cy3-dCTPs and Cy5-dCTPs were incorporated and the reverse transcribed probes hybridized on the arrays as described in “Hybridization protocol”.
Reverse transcription was carried out as follows: 3 µl random hexanucleotide primers (6 N) and 16.5 µl precipitated RNA were mixed and incubated at 65 °C for 10 min. The reaction mix was then incubated at room temperature for further 10 min and on ice for 2 min. Now 8 µl 5 x RT reaction buffer (Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen), 4 µl dNTP Mastermix (dATP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dGTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dTTP - 100 mM, 5 µl; dCTP - 100 mM, 2 µl ad 100 µl bidestilled RNase free H2O), 4 µl Cy3-dCTP and Cy5-dCTP (1 mM) respectively, 4 µl DTT (0.1 M, Superscript II Kit, Invitrogen) and 1.5 µl Superscript II (200 U, Invitrogen) were added. This mixture was incubated for 2 h at 42 °C. The reaction was stopped by adding 10 µl of a sodium hydroxide solution (1 M) and heating to 65 °C for 10 min. The solution was neutralized by adding 10 µl of hydrochloric acid (1 M). 200 µl 1 x TE buffer was added and the mixture purified using the PCR Purification Kit as recommended by the manufacturer (Qiagen). cDNA concentration was determined photometrically (Nanodrop ND 1000, NanoDrop Technologies, Inc.) and identical amounts of labeled cDNA were combined and vacuum dried at 30 °C until nearly dry. The cDNA was redissolved in 65 µl prewarmed (42 °C) hybridization buffer (MWG) and stored for subsequent use - either on ice for less than 1 h or at -20 °C when stored overnight.

The slides were hybridized in the fully automatic hybridization station HS400 (Tecan Deutschland GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). Labeled cDNA samples were prepared by heating them to 95 °C for 3 min. The hybridization lasted for 12 h at 42 °C. 6 x SSPE (20 x stock: NaCl 175.3 g; NaH2PO4 x 1H2O 27.6 g; Na2EDTA 7.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) was used for pre-wetting; washing buffer 1 (NaCl 17.6 g; sodium citrate 8.8 g; SDS 1 g; ddH2O ad 1 l) and washing buffer 2 (NaCl 0.88 g; NaCitrate 4.4 g; bidestilled H2O ad 1 l) were used for washing the hybridized slides which were subsequently dried with nitrogen gas for two minutes.

    <Scan-Protocol>
The completely dryed DNA microarrays were scanned using the ScanArray Express Microarray Scanner (Perkin Elmer, Massachusetts, USA) (resolution: 5 µM; PMT setting: 70). Pictures of both channels were saved as 16- bit tiff files.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Raw data were created by analyzing 16-bit tiff files with the Scan Array Express imaging software (microarray analysis system, version 3.0.0.0016, PerkinElmer, Massachusetts, USA; adaptive treshold method, total normalization method).
Adaptive threshold (quantitation method) uses the parameters of the spot diameter and background inner and outer dimensions to create a spot mask and background mask, then refines the mask on a pixel-by-pixel basis. Total (normalization method), uses the intensity of each spot in relation to all spots.
The VALUE data are normalized log2(test/ref) ratios which were normalized 'print-tip-loess' using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). Additionally, spots, which were classified as not found by the image analysis software, were down weighted to 10%.

    <Summary>
A time series of whole-genome transcription profiling of E. coli K-12 W3110 was performed to study the dynamic physiological response of E. coli K-12 W3110 to limited carbon conditions. cDNA from eight time intervals after glucose limitation, representing different stages of glucose depletion, along with cDNA of an unrestricted growth were hybridized to whole-genome microarrays of E. coli K-12. Glucose concentrations were gradually reduced in a fed-batch cultivation process with constant feeding rate in a bioreactor.
Major focus was put on the dynamic changes in the transcription level of genes involved in the central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway, TCA cycle and glyoxylate shunt), high-affinity glucose transport systems, movement, growth, and stress response.
In total, 40 microarrays were hybridized. The data were statistically analysed using the software R (R, 2005) and the Limma package included (Smyth, 2005). The data were normalized “print-tip-loess”. “Multiple hypothesis testing” correction was performed with the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995), which controls the “false discovery rate” (fdr). Genes were regarded as differentially expressed when the “adjusted p values” were &lt; 0.05, therefore nominally controlling the expected fdr to less than 0.05.
The reproducibility of dye swap experiments as well as biological replicates was estimated by calculating “Pearson’s correlation coefficients”. A high correlation was observed for the dye swap pairs (with averaged Pearson’s correlation coefficients of 0.89 ± 0.06 for the reference samples and of 0.87 ± 0.08 for the different points of time) as well as for biological replicates (with averaged Pearson’s correlation coefficients of 0.86 ± 0.04 for the red channel (Cy5) and 0.80 ± 0.09 for the green channel (Cy3)).

Description:
Data_tables_B1-B8 report statistical values (A: average intensity value (1/2log2(test*ref)); M: average expression value (log2(test/ref)), t and P.value ('adjusted P.value')) for every point in time (studied conditions are described above for the corresponding table). Every differentially expressed gene of the corresponding point in time according to the reference sample is listed. Genes were regarded as differentially expressed when their 'adjusted P.values' were &lt; 0.05, therefore nominally controlling the expected fdr to less than 0.05. The data are based on maximal three biological replicates (three independent fed-batch cultivations).

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Hybridization involved the hybridization of a common reference (unlimited growth, batch phase) on all arrays together with each sample of interest. This allowed the direct comparison of the transcripts of a time series taken during fed-batch cultivation with the unlimited reference sample. All samples were taken in duplicates and the experiments were performed as dye swap experiments.
The first four samples of the time series (T1 - T4) were taken from three individual fed-batch cultivations (three biological replicates), the subsequent four samples (T5 - T8) were taken only from two individual fed-batch cultivations. On each array, the genes were spotted in duplicates. Therefore, twelve replicates (duplicates on dye swaps for three cultivations) were analyzed for T1 – T4 and eight replicates (duplicates on dye swaps for two cultivations) were analyzed for T5 – T8.
