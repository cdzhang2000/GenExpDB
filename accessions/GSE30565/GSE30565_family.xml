To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo sample), we used TRIzol preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Typhi.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P.1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).  We performed three rounds of SCOTS on in vivo and in vitro cDNA samples, as previously described (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).

Analysis used in vitro RNA as control samples for comparison to the in vivo samples
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities.  For each individual patient, we considered a gene to be detected in vivo if at least 2 of the 3 replicate gene spots on each of the four slides for that infected human was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Typhi CT18 or Ty2 genomes.  For those genes we detected in vivo, we evaluated whether there was a difference in expression when compared to detection levels for in vitro grown organisms.  For this latter statistical analysis, we included genes with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity less than 50% within an array, and employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects to LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data.  Those genes with a False Discovery Rate of less than 0.05 computed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment and a 2-fold variation in signal intensity were considered differentially expressed in vivo versus in vitro.   Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetical Research, 77:123-128 which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities.  For each individual patient, we considered a gene to be detected in vivo if at least 2 of the 3 replicate gene spots on each of the four slides for that infected human was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Typhi CT18 or Ty2 genomes.  For those genes we detected in vivo, we evaluated whether there was a difference in expression when compared to detection levels for in vitro grown organisms.  For this latter statistical analysis, we included genes with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity less than 50% within an array, and employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects to LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data.  Those genes with a False Discovery Rate of less than 0.05 computed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment and a 2-fold variation in signal intensity were considered differentially expressed in vivo versus in vitro.   Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetical Research, 77:123-128 which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo sample), we used TRIzol preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Typhi.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P.1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).  We performed three rounds of SCOTS on in vivo and in vitro cDNA samples, as previously described (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).

To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P.1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).  We performed three rounds of SCOTS on in vivo and in vitro cDNA samples, as previously described (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).

Analysis used in vitro RNA as control samples for comparison to the in vivo samples
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities.  For each individual patient, we considered a gene to be detected in vivo if at least 2 of the 3 replicate gene spots on each of the four slides for that infected human was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Typhi CT18 or Ty2 genomes.  For those genes we detected in vivo, we evaluated whether there was a difference in expression when compared to detection levels for in vitro grown organisms.  For this latter statistical analysis, we included genes with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity less than 50% within an array, and employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects to LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data.  Those genes with a False Discovery Rate of less than 0.05 computed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment and a 2-fold variation in signal intensity were considered differentially expressed in vivo versus in vitro.   Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetical Research, 77:123-128 which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo sample), we used TRIzol preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Typhi.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P.1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).

Analysis used in vitro RNA as control samples for comparison to the in vivo samples
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities.  For each individual patient, we considered a gene to be detected in vivo if at least 2 of the 3 replicate gene spots on each of the four slides for that infected human was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Typhi CT18 or Ty2 genomes.  For those genes we detected in vivo, we evaluated whether there was a difference in expression when compared to detection levels for in vitro grown organisms.  For this latter statistical analysis, we included genes with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity less than 50% within an array, and employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects to LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data.  Those genes with a False Discovery Rate of less than 0.05 computed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment and a 2-fold variation in signal intensity were considered differentially expressed in vivo versus in vitro.   Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetical Research, 77:123-128 which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo sample), we used TRIzol preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Typhi.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P.1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).  We performed three rounds of SCOTS on in vivo and in vitro cDNA samples, as previously described (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559).

Analysis used in vitro RNA as control samples for comparison to the in vivo samples
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities.  For each individual patient, we considered a gene to be detected in vivo if at least 2 of the 3 replicate gene spots on each of the four slides for that infected human was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Typhi CT18 or Ty2 genomes.  For those genes we detected in vivo, we evaluated whether there was a difference in expression when compared to detection levels for in vitro grown organisms.  For this latter statistical analysis, we included genes with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity less than 50% within an array, and employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects to LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data.  Those genes with a False Discovery Rate of less than 0.05 computed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment and a 2-fold variation in signal intensity were considered differentially expressed in vivo versus in vitro.   Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetical Research, 77:123-128 which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities.  For each individual patient, we considered a gene to be detected in vivo if at least 2 of the 3 replicate gene spots on each of the four slides for that infected human was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Typhi CT18 or Ty2 genomes.  For those genes we detected in vivo, we evaluated whether there was a difference in expression when compared to detection levels for in vitro grown organisms.  For this latter statistical analysis, we included genes with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity less than 50% within an array, and employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects to LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data.  Those genes with a False Discovery Rate of less than 0.05 computed using Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing adjustment and a 2-fold variation in signal intensity were considered differentially expressed in vivo versus in vitro.   Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetical Research, 77:123-128 which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo sample), we used TRIzol preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Typhi.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio

    <Title>In vivo expression of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi genes in the blood of patients with typhoid fever in Bangladesh</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE30565</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>22180799</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
We applied an RNA capture and amplification technique, Selective Capture of Transcribed Sequences (SCOTS), and microarray hybridization to identify S. Typhi transcripts expressed in the blood of five humans infected with S. Typhi in Bangladesh.  In total, we detected the expression of mRNAs for 2046 S. Typhi genes (44% of the S. Typhi genome) in human blood; expression of 912 genes was detected in all 5 patients, and expression of 1100 genes was detected in 4 or more patients.  Identified transcripts were associated with the virulence-associated PhoP regulon, Salmonella pathogenicity islands, the use of alternative carbon and energy sources, synthesis and transport of iron, thiamine, and biotin, and resistance to antimicrobial peptides and oxidative stress.  The most highly represented group were genes currently annotated as encoding proteins designated as hypothetical, unknown, or unclassified.  Of the 2046 detected transcripts, 1320 (29% of the S. Typhi genome) had significantly different levels of detection in human blood compared to in vitro cultures; detection of 141 transcripts was significantly different in all 5 patients, and detection of 331 transcripts varied in at least 4 patients.  These mRNAs encode proteins of unknown function, those involved in energy metabolism, transport and binding, cell envelope, cellular processes, and pathogenesis.  We confirmed increased expression of a subset of identified mRNAs by quantitative-PCR.
