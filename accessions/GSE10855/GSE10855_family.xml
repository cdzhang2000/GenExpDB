    <Manufacture-Protocol>
We produced in-house DNA microarrays that contain PCR-amplified fragment of DNA derived from predicted open reading frames (ORFs) in the E. coli genome.  All PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels.  Reactions that resulted in undetectable PCR products were re-amplified using a lower annealing temperature. All PCR products from the final round of amplifications were precipitated with ethanol, then dissolved in 50% DMSO (100-150 μg/ml) and spotted onto Corning GAPS II slides using Affymetrix GMS 417 Arrayer (Santa Clara, CA) in duplicate on each slide. Arrayed slides were baked at 80˚ C for 2 hours and stored in a desiccator at room temperature under vacuum.
    </Manufacture-Protocol>
    <Description>
The Platform data table reflects a condensed representation of the duplicate-spotted PCR products on the physical array.

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

E. coli strain MG1655
Sample data table reports condensed data from 2 biological replicates (2 technical_replicates/biological_replicate).
CH1: Cy5-rep1, Cy5-rep2; CH2: Cy3-rep1, Cy3-rep2

All PCR products on the related array (GPL6570) were printed in duplicate.  Each GPR file was generated for a single replicate: file name &quot;*_rep1&quot; represents replicate 1 and file name &quot;*_rep2&quot; represents replicate 2.  The biological replicates were indicated by the number preceding _rep1 or _rep2.
For example, files:
GSM275371_12487105_rep1.gpr &amp; GSM275371_12487105_rep2.gpr
= print replicate #1 (rep1) and print replicate #2 (rep2) for experimental treatment 1 (12487105, tmUp1).
and
GSM275371_12493496_a_rep1.gpr &amp; GSM275371_12493496_a_rep2.gpr
= print replicate #1 (rep1) and print replicate #2 (rep2) for experimental treatment 2 (12493496, tmUp2) .
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Cy-dye labeled genomic DNA and RNA-derived cDNA probes were combined with a hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 10 μg Salmon sperm DNA) and hybridized for ~ 16 hours at 42 C to a DNA microarray.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarray slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments), and fluorescence data for each of the duplicates on each slide were analyzed using GENEPIX PRO 4.0 software.

E. coli strain MG1655
Sample data table reports condensed data from 2 biological replicates (2 technical_replicates/biological_replicate).
CH1: Cy5-rep1, Cy5-rep2; CH2: Cy3-rep1, Cy3-rep2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

Physiological perturbations were carried out under a controlled environment in the context of bioreactor (Bioflo 110, New Brunswick Scientific) growth. Thermoelectric sensors and heaters were used to shift temperature profiles between 250 C and 370 C, and polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors (Mettler Toledo) and nitrogen gas was used to rapidly change oxygen saturation between anaerobic (0% dissolved oxygen) and aerobic (16-21% dissolved oxygen) condition.
      </Treatment-Protocol>

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Physiological perturbations were carried out under a controlled environment in the context of bioreactor (Bioflo 110, New Brunswick Scientific) growth. Thermoelectric sensors and heaters were used to shift temperature profiles between 250 C and 370 C, and polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors (Mettler Toledo) and nitrogen gas was used to rapidly change oxygen saturation between anaerobic (0% dissolved oxygen) and aerobic (16-21% dissolved oxygen) condition.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bacteria were grown in batch or bioreactor vessels in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.4% glucose.

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Cy-dye labeled genomic DNA and RNA-derived cDNA probes were combined with a hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 10 μg Salmon sperm DNA) and hybridized for ~ 16 hours at 42 C to a DNA microarray.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarray slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments), and fluorescence data for each of the duplicates on each slide were analyzed using GENEPIX PRO 4.0 software.

E. coli strain MG1655
Sample data table reports condensed data from 2 biological replicates (2 technical_replicates/biological_replicate).
CH1: Cy5-rep1, Cy3-rep2; CH2: Cy3-rep1, Cy5-rep2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

Physiological perturbations were carried out under a controlled environment in the context of bioreactor (Bioflo 110, New Brunswick Scientific) growth. Thermoelectric sensors and heaters were used to shift temperature profiles between 250 C and 370 C, and polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors (Mettler Toledo) and nitrogen gas was used to rapidly change oxygen saturation between anaerobic (0% dissolved oxygen) and aerobic (16-21% dissolved oxygen) condition.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bacteria were grown in batch or bioreactor vessels in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.4% glucose.

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Cy-dye labeled genomic DNA and RNA-derived cDNA probes were combined with a hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 10 μg Salmon sperm DNA) and hybridized for ~ 16 hours at 42 C to a DNA microarray.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarray slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments), and fluorescence data for each of the duplicates on each slide were analyzed using GENEPIX PRO 4.0 software.

Sample data table reports condensed data from 2 biological replicates (2 technical_replicates/biological_replicate).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Cy-dye labeled genomic DNA and RNA-derived cDNA probes were combined with a hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 10 μg Salmon sperm DNA) and hybridized for ~ 16 hours at 42 C to a DNA microarray.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarray slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments), and fluorescence data for each of the duplicates on each slide were analyzed using GENEPIX PRO 4.0 software.

E. coli strain MG1655
Sample data table reports condensed data from 2 biological replicates (2 technical_replicates/biological_replicate).
CH1: Cy5-rep1, Cy3-rep2; CH2: Cy3-rep1, Cy5-rep2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

Physiological perturbations were carried out under a controlled environment in the context of bioreactor (Bioflo 110, New Brunswick Scientific) growth. Thermoelectric sensors and heaters were used to shift temperature profiles between 250 C and 370 C, and polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors (Mettler Toledo) and nitrogen gas was used to rapidly change oxygen saturation between anaerobic (0% dissolved oxygen) and aerobic (16-21% dissolved oxygen) condition.
      </Treatment-Protocol>

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

Physiological perturbations were carried out under a controlled environment in the context of bioreactor (Bioflo 110, New Brunswick Scientific) growth. Thermoelectric sensors and heaters were used to shift temperature profiles between 250 C and 370 C, and polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors (Mettler Toledo) and nitrogen gas was used to rapidly change oxygen saturation between anaerobic (0% dissolved oxygen) and aerobic (16-21% dissolved oxygen) condition.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bacteria were grown in batch or bioreactor vessels in M9 minimal media supplemented with 0.4% glucose.

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Cy-dye labeled genomic DNA and RNA-derived cDNA probes were combined with a hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 50% formamide, and 10 μg Salmon sperm DNA) and hybridized for ~ 16 hours at 42 C to a DNA microarray.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarray slides were scanned on a GenePix 4000B scanner (Axon Instruments), and fluorescence data for each of the duplicates on each slide were analyzed using GENEPIX PRO 4.0 software.

E. coli strain MG1655
Sample data table reports condensed data from 2 biological replicates (2 technical_replicates/biological_replicate).
CH1: Cy5-rep1, Cy3-rep2; CH2: Cy3-rep1, Cy5-rep2
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

Fluorescent cDNA was synthesized from total RNA with 15 μg of total RNA serving as template. Cyanine-labeled Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP (Amersham Bioscience) and pdN6 random hexamers (GE healthcare) were used in reverse transcription reactions utilizing SuperScript II (Invitrogen, CA) for cDNA synthesis. Fluorescent genomic DNA was generated as described in (Girgis et al., 2007). Genomic DNA served as a universal reference for all hybridizations. E. coli genomic DNA was fragmented (500 – 2000 bp) using mechanical shearing, and subjected to Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP labeling using the BioPrime DNA labeling system (Invitrogen, CA).

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Elements with poor spot morphology or exhibiting uneven hybridization caused by dust particles or scratches, were flagged manually and excluded from further analyses. After local background  subtraction and global normalization relative to the genomic DNA reference, duplicate measurements on the same array were averaged, yielding a single vector for each time-point across a perturbation. The data from all hybridizations were combined into a matrix and scaled relative to each other using quantile-normalization as implemented in the Matlab Bioinformatics  toolbox. Biological duplicates from all experiments were averaged, leading to a single set of time-series data for each perturbation. Seven time-points were assayed for each perturbation, corresponding to 0, 4, 8, 12, 20, 28, and 44 minutes post transition.

RNA extraction: A hot-phenol procedure was used to extract total RNA. Cell pellets were lysed with 500 μl TE (pH8.0), 50 μl 10% SDS and lysozyme (0.5 mg/ml). Total RNA was extracted sequentially with phenol/chloroform (preheated to 640 C), followed by chloroform/isoamyl alcohol. RNA was precipitated with 1/10 volume of 3M NaOAc (pH 5.2) and 2 volumes of ethanol. After incubating overnight at –200 C, samples were spun down and pellets were washed with ice cold 70% ethanol (prepared with DEPC- H2O). RNA was resuspended in water, DNase treated (RQ1 RNase-free DNase/ Promega, WI) and purified using an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, CA).

    <Summary>
Microarray transcriptional profiling was utilized to observe the global cellular state correlates of the physiological responses to temperature and oxygen changes.  We provide evidence for the existence of correlations of Escherichia coli transcriptional responses to temperature and oxygen perturbations-precisely mirroring the co-occurrence of these parameters upon transitions between the outside world and the mammalian gastrointestinal-tract.
Keywords: time course
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Physiological perturbations were carried out under a controlled environment in the context of bioreactor  (Bioflo 110, New Brunswick Scientific) growth. Thermoelectric sensors and heaters were used to shift  temperature profiles between 25 C and 37 C, and polarographic dissolved oxygen sensors (Mettler  Toledo) and nitrogen gas was used to rapidly change oxygen saturation between anaerobic (0% dissolved  oxygen) and aerobic (16-21% dissolved oxygen) condition. The cultures were maintained in exponential  phase (O.D.600 0.2-0.4) through controlled dilution, where fresh media is pumped in and spent media is  pumped out at a controlled rate. Prior to the perturbations, cells were maintained in the pre-transition  environment for at least eight generations (8-24 hours). All experiments were performed in duplicate.
