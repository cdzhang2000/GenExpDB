    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

Grown in Davis's Mineral Salts medium (Gibco BRL Life Technologies Inc.) with 0.1% D-glucose at 25 C (100 r.p.m. shaking) until an OD (550 nm) of 0.6.

RNA was obtained using the RNAeasy MIDI RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) using lysis buffer containing 0.1% beta-mercaptoethanol. RNA was extracted from lysates and purified according to the manufacturer’s standard protocol and subsequently stored at -80°C. RNA quality was assessed with electrophoresis using a RNA bioanalyser 2100 and Lab RNAChip (Agilent Technologies) before progression to microarray hybridization.

Gene expression was assessed on Affymetrix E. coli Genome GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Briefly, total RNA was prepared from E. coli cells by phenol-chloroform extraction, and ~10 µg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA. After purification with a Qiagen cDNA purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.), the cDNA was fragmented with DNase I. The fragmented cDNA was end biotinylated by terminal transferase with biotinylated ddATP.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented, biotinylated cDNA to a chip, washing, and staining of the chip was done on an Affymetrix workstation as described previously (Expression Analysis Technical Manual; Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Detailed method is equivalent to that described by Soupene and colleagues: http://nature.berkeley.edu/%7eopaliy/papers/MG1655/MAprotocol.pdf

    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanning of the chip were done on an Affymetrix workstation as described previously (Expression Analysis Technical Manual; Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.).

    <Description>
The sucrose and NaCl hyperosmotic treatment data were compared to the no treatment control data separately.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Background correction, normalization and calculation of the expression measures were performed using RMA procedure with the WebArray platform (http://bioinformatics.skcc.org/webarray/). Subsequently the program EDGE (http://www.biostat.washington.edu/software/jstorey/edge/) was used to estimate the conditional false discovery rate (FDR), the expected proportion of false positives conditioned on having k 'significant' findings.

Gene expression was assessed on Affymetrix E. coli Genome GeneChip arrays (Affymetrix, Inc., Santa Clara, Calif.). Briefly, total RNA was prepared from E. coli cells by phenol-chloroform extraction, and ~10 µg of total RNA was used to synthesize cDNA. After purification with a Qiagen cDNA purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.), the cDNA was fragmented with DNase I. The fragmented cDNA was end biotinylated by terminal transferase with biotinylated ddATP.

    <Title>Ion transport and osmotic adjustment in E. coli in response to ionic and non-ionic osmotica</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE12190</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>18793315</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Bacteria respond to osmotic stress by a substantial increase in the intracellular osmolality, adjusting their cell turgor for altered growth conditions. Using E. coli as a model organism we demonstrate here that bacterial responses to hyperosmotic stress specifically depend on the nature of osmoticum used. We show that increasing acute hyperosmotic NaCl stress above ~1.0 Os kg-1 causes a dose-dependent K+ leak from the cell, resulting in a substantial decrease in cytosolic K+ content and a concurrent accumulation of Na+ in the cell. At the same time, isotonic sucrose or mannitol treatment (non-ionic osmotica) results in a gradual increase of the net K+ uptake. Ion flux data is consistent with growth experiments showing that bacterial growth is impaired by NaCl at the concentration resulting in a switch from net K+ uptake to efflux. Microarray experiments reveal that about 40% of up-regulated genes shared no similarity in their responses to NaCl and sucrose treatment, further suggesting specificity of osmotic adjustment in E. coli to ionic- and non-ionic osmotica The observed differences are explained by the specificity of the stress-induced changes in the membrane potential of bacterial cells highlighting the importance of voltage-gated K+ transporters for bacterial adaptation to hyperosmotic stress.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Two biological replicates per treatment with microarray analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip E. coli Genome array. Treatments used included:
Control - E. coli Frag1, grown to early stationary growth phase in a mineral salts medium with 0.1% glucose at 25 C
Sucrose hyperosmotic treatment - 1.25 M sucrose added to control culture
for 10 min.
NaCl hyperosmotic treatment - 1.37 M NaCl added to control culture

For microarray data comparisons the sucrose and NaCl hyperosmotic treatment data was compared to the no treatment control data separately. The sucrose to control and NaCL to control comparison data tables are linked below.
