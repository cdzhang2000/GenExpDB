To synthesize cDNA, 2.5 ug of total RNA was reversely transcribed. cDNA was synthesized using 2 ul of Smart® reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 1 ul of random hexamers in the presence of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) [Invitrogen], 25 mM dNTP with 3:2 ratio of aminoallyl (aa)-dUTP and dTTP (Ambion, Austin, TX). After cDNA synthesis, the cDNA was purified and unincorpotated aa-dUTP was removed using a MinElute® PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified cDNA resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) was labelled with cy5.

After cDNA synthesis, the cDNA was purified and unincorpotated aa-dUTP was removed using a MinElute® PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified cDNA resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) was labelled with cy3.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
About 5.8 ug of each labelled cDNA were hybridized, resuspended in 50 ml hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5X sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer, 0.1% SDS, and 0.6 ug/ul salmon sperm DNA), and loaded on a microarray slide. The slide was incubated for 16 h at 42 C, and then washed with low, medium, and high stringency buffer containing 0.1 mM DTT.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The hybridized slides were scanned at 10 um resolutions within the range of photomultiplier tube between 650 and 750 on two channels, cy3 and cy5 dyes using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Data were obtained from three biological and four technical replicates (n = 12). For each biological replicate, flip dye analysis was performed. The expression level of genes obtained from the mean of each gene on the twelve slides was considered significantly different over 1.5 fold changes. The difference was presented at a significant level (P &lt; 0.05). 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The signal intensity of spots on the slides was adjusted and quantified by background subtraction using Spotfinder software. Data LOWESS normalization was performed using Ginkgo software. The data from the normalized ratio of query to reference signal for each spot were transformed using a log2 scale.

To synthesize cDNA, 2.5 ug of total RNA was reversely transcribed. cDNA was synthesized using 2 ul of Smart® reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 1 ul of random hexamers in the presence of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) [Invitrogen], 25 mM dNTP with 3:2 ratio of aminoallyl (aa)-dUTP and dTTP (Ambion, Austin, TX). After cDNA synthesis, the cDNA was purified and unincorpotated aa-dUTP was removed using a MinElute® PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified cDNA resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) was labelled with cy3.

The purified cDNA resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) was labelled with cy5.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
About 5.8 ug of each labelled cDNA were hybridized, resuspended in 50 ml hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5X sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer, 0.1% SDS, and 0.6 ug/ul salmon sperm DNA) and loaded on a microarray slide. The slide was incubated for 16h at 42 °C, and then washed with low, medium, and high stringency buffer containing 0.1 mM DTT.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The hybridized slides were scanned at 10 um resolutions within the range of photomultiplier tube between 650 and 750 on two channels (cy3 and cy5) using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Data were obtained from three biological and four technical replicates (n = 12). For each biological replicate, flip dye analysis was performed. The expression level of genes obtained from the mean of each gene on the twelve slides was considered significantly different over 1.5 fold changes. The difference was presented at a significant level (P &lt; 0.05).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The signal intensity of spots on the slides was adjusted and quantified by background subtraction using Spotfinder software. Data LOWESS normalization was performed using Ginkgo software. The data from the normalized ratio of query to reference signal for each spot were transformed using a log2 scale.

To synthesize cDNA, 2.5 ug of total RNA was reversely transcribed. cDNA was synthesized using 2 ul of Smart® reverse transcriptase (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 1 ul of random hexamers in the presence of 0.1 M dithiothreitol (DTT) [Invitrogen], 25 mM dNTP with 3:2 ratio of aminoallyl (aa)-dUTP and dTTP (Ambion, Austin, TX). After cDNA synthesis, the cDNA was purified and unincorpotated aa-dUTP was removed using a MinElute® PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The purified cDNA resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) was labelled with cy3.

The purified cDNA resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) was labelled with cy5.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
About 5.8 ug of each labelled cDNA were hybridized, resuspended in 50 ml hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5X sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer, 0.1% SDS, and 0.6 ug/ul salmon sperm DNA) and loaded on a microarray slide. The slide was incubated for 16h at 42 °C, and then washed with low, medium, and high stringency buffer containing 0.1 mM DTT.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The hybridized slides were scanned at 10 um resolutions within the range of photomultiplier tube between 650 and 750 on two channels (cy3 and cy5) using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Data were obtained from three biological and four technical replicates (n = 12). For each biological replicate, flip dye analysis was performed. The expression level of genes obtained from the mean of each gene on the twelve slides was considered significantly different over 1.5 fold changes. The difference was presented at a significant level (P &lt; 0.05).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The signal intensity of spots on the slides was adjusted and quantified by background subtraction using Spotfinder software. Data LOWESS normalization was performed using Ginkgo software. The data from the normalized ratio of query to reference signal for each spot were transformed using a log2 scale.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
About 5.8 ug of each labelled cDNA were hybridized, resuspended in 50 ml hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5X sodium chloride/sodium citrate buffer, 0.1% SDS, and 0.6 ug/ul salmon sperm DNA) and loaded on a microarray slide. The slide was incubated for 16h at 42 °C, and then washed with low, medium, and high stringency buffer containing 0.1 mM DTT.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The hybridized slides were scanned at 10 um resolutions within the range of photomultiplier tube between 650 and 750 on two channels (cy3 and cy5) using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Data were obtained from three biological and four technical replicates (n = 12). For each biological replicate, flip dye analysis was performed. The expression level of genes obtained from the mean of each gene on the twelve slides was considered significantly different over 1.5 fold changes. The difference was presented at a significant level (P &lt; 0.05).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The signal intensity of spots on the slides was adjusted and quantified by background subtraction using Spotfinder software. Data LOWESS normalization was performed using Ginkgo software. The data from the normalized ratio of query to reference signal for each spot were transformed using a log2 scale.

    <Summary>
The gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes strain F2365 grown in BHI agar (reference) or on a turkey deli meat (query) was examined. Aminosilane-coated cDNA microarray slide was used. The data from the normalized ratio of query to reference signal for each spot were transformed using a log2 scale. The expression level of genes obtained from the mean of each gene on the twelve slides was considered significantly different over 1.5 fold changes. Thirty nine and forty five genes in L. monocytogenes grown on a turkey meat matrix were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
To examine the gene expression profiles of L. monocytogenes grown in BHI agar or on a turkey deli meat, L. monocytogenes strains 4b F2365 aminosilane-coated cDNA microarray slide was used. Cy3 and Cy5 dyes were used for cDNA labelling. Data were obtained from three biological and four technical replicates (n = 12). Each biological replicate included a flip dye assay. TM4 package developed by TIGR was used to analyze the data.
