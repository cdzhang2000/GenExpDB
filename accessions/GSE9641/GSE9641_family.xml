      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA from S. mutans was isolated from 50 ml cultures that were grown under the desired conditions and harvested by centrifugation at 4ºC. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 ml of DEPC-treated water, 800 ml of RNA protect reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with vortexing for 10 s at one minute intervals. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 ml Tris-EDTA (50:10) buffer and transferred to 1.5 ml screw cap tubes containing sterile glass beads (0.1 mm avg. diam.; Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), 100 ml of 1% SDS and 650 ml of acid phenol:chloroform (5:1). The mixture was homogenized in a Bead Beater twice for 40 s and chilled on ice for 2 min between cycles. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed at 4ºC. Two additional hot acid phenol:chloroform extractions were performed followed by one extraction with chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1). RNA was precipitated in the presence of isopropanol and sodium acetate, pH 5, at -20ºC for 1 h, followed by multiple washes with 70% ethanol, one wash with 99% ethanol, and drying in vacuo. RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water and digested with DNAseI (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was re-purified and treated on-column with DNaseI using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), as recommended by the supplier.

All RNAs were purified as described above and used to generate cDNA according to the protocol provided by TIGR with the following minor modifications. The amount of RNA in each reaction was increased to 10 ug and the molar ratio of dTTP:aa-dUTP was increased to 1:2. SuperscriptIII Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to increase cDNA yields. Purified cDNAs were coupled with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-dUTP

    <Data-Processing>
After the slides were scanned, single-channel images were loaded into TIGR Spotfinder software and overlayed. A spot grid was created according to TIGR specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots within the grid, then the intensity values of each spot were measured. Data was normalized using Microarray data analysis software (MIDAS), by using LOWESS and Iterative Log Mean Centering with default settings.

RNA from S. mutans was isolated from 50 ml cultures that were grown under the desired conditions and harvested by centrifugation at 4ºC. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 ml of DEPC-treated water, 800 ml of RNA protect reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with vortexing for 10 s at one minute intervals. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 ml Tris-EDTA (50:10) buffer and transferred to 1.5 ml screw cap tubes containing sterile glass beads (0.1 mm avg. diam.; Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), 100 ml of 1% SDS and 650 ml of acid phenol:chloroform (5:1). The mixture was homogenized in a Bead Beater twice for 40 s and chilled on ice for 2 min between cycles. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed at 4ºC. Two additional hot acid phenol:chloroform extractions were performed followed by one extraction with chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1). RNA was precipitated in the presence of isopropanol and sodium acetate, pH 5, at -20ºC for 1 h, followed by multiple washes with 70% ethanol, one wash with 99% ethanol, and drying in vacuo. RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water and digested with DNAseI (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was re-purified and treated on-column with DNaseI using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), as recommended by the supplier.

All RNAs were purified as described above and used to generate cDNA according to the protocol provided by TIGR with the following minor modifications. The amount of RNA in each reaction was increased to 10 ug and the molar ratio of dTTP:aa-dUTP was increased to 1:2. SuperscriptIII Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to increase cDNA yields. Purified cDNAs were coupled with indocarbocyanine (Cy5)-dUTP

After the slides were scanned, single-channel images were loaded into TIGR Spotfinder software and overlayed. A spot grid was created according to TIGR specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots within the grid, then the intensity values of each spot were measured. Data was normalized using Microarray data analysis software (MIDAS), by using LOWESS and Iterative Log Mean Centering with default settings.

RNA from S. mutans was isolated from 50 ml cultures that were grown under the desired conditions and harvested by centrifugation at 4ºC. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 ml of DEPC-treated water, 800 ml of RNA protect reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with vortexing for 10 s at one minute intervals. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 ml Tris-EDTA (50:10) buffer and transferred to 1.5 ml screw cap tubes containing sterile glass beads (0.1 mm avg. diam.; Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), 100 ml of 1% SDS and 650 ml of acid phenol:chloroform (5:1). The mixture was homogenized in a Bead Beater twice for 40 s and chilled on ice for 2 min between cycles. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed at 4ºC. Two additional hot acid phenol:chloroform extractions were performed followed by one extraction with chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1). RNA was precipitated in the presence of isopropanol and sodium acetate, pH 5, at -20ºC for 1 h, followed by multiple washes with 70% ethanol, one wash with 99% ethanol, and drying in vacuo. RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water and digested with DNAseI (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was re-purified and treated on-column with DNaseI using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), as recommended by the supplier.

After the slides were scanned, single-channel images were loaded into TIGR Spotfinder software and overlayed. A spot grid was created according to TIGR specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots within the grid, then the intensity values of each spot were measured. Data was normalized using Microarray data analysis software (MIDAS), by using LOWESS and Iterative Log Mean Centering with default settings.

    <Title>The CodY Regulon in Streptoccus mutans</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>18539745</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
In this report, codY mutant strains were constructed and used to demonstrate the relationship of (p)ppGpp synthesized by RelP and RelQ with the activation of CodY.  In addition, because CodY has not been studied in S. mutans, we used microarrays to demonstrate that this protein function as a global regulator of gene expression in S. mutans.   
Keywords: stress response, gene knockout analysis
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
For microarray analysis, cells were grown in complete FMC to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.3 collected by centrifugation, quick frozen in a dry-ice/ethanol bath, and stored at - 80∞C for RNA isolation.

RNA was isolated from exponential phase (OD600 0.3), as described previously.  All samples were digested with DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) and purified using the RNeasy mini kit column (Qiagen, Inc., Chatsworth, CA).  RNA concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically in triplicate and one µg of RNA was run in a formaldehyde gel to verify RNA quality.  Reverse transcription (RT) reaction was performed with 10 mg of RNA following the protocol provided by TIGR with minor modifications.  Transcriptome analysis was performed using the S. mutans UA159 microarrays provided by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR).  The microarrays consisted of 1,948 70-mer oligonucleotides representing 1,960 open reading frames printed four times on the surface of each microarray slide.  Additional details regarding the arrays are available at http://pfgrc.tigr.org/descriptions/S_mutans.shtml.  A reference RNA prepared from a large-scale culture of S. mutans UA159 cells that had been grown in BHI broth to an OD600 = 0.5 was used in every experiment.   cDNA labeling was performed according to TIGR protocols with minor modifications as described elsewhere.  Four cDNA samples originating from four independent cultures of UA159 and JLcodY strains were hybridized to the arrays along with the reference cDNA, generating a total of 16 slides.  Hybridizations were performed in a Maui hybridization chamber (BioMicro Systems, Salt Lake City, UT).  Additional details regarding array protocols are available at http://pfgrc.tigr.org/protocols/protocols.shtml.  Data from all individual experiments were analyzed using Spotfinder software and normalized using Midas according to TIGR specifications (http://www.tigr.org/software/).  Statistical analysis was carried out using BRB Arrays Tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html) with a P-value of 0.001.
