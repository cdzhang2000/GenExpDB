    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
At OD~0.5, IPTG was added to 1mM and growth was continued for 15min. The strains employed here did not contain lacIq on the chromosome, and thus GraL was beeing constitutivley overexpressed +/- IPTG. IPTG was added to mirror the experiments where GraL was overproduced for short periods of time.

      <Extract-Protocol>
5 OD units were removed from the culture and immediately added to an equal volume of ice-cold RNAlater reagent (Ambion). Thus treated samples were stored for 20min on ice. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Following fragmentation, cDNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on E. coli 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 using the Mini_prok2v1_450 protocol.

At OD~0.5, IPTG was added to 1mM and growth was continued for 15min. The strains employed here did not contain lacIq on the chromosome, and thus GraL was beeing constitutivley overexpressed +/- IPTG. IPTG was added to mirror the experiments where GraL was overproduced for short periods of time.

5 OD units were removed from the culture and immediately added to an equal volume of ice-cold RNAlater reagent (Ambion). Thus treated samples were stored for 20min on ice. Total RNA was extracted with Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) following manufacturer's instructions.

Biotinylated cDNA were prepared according to the standard Affymetrix protocol from 10 ug total RNA (Prokaryotic Traget Preparation in Affymetrix GeneChip® Expression Analysis Technical Manual).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Following fragmentation, cDNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on E. coli 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450 using the Mini_prok2v1_450 protocol.

Gene expression data from cells at OD~ 0.5

    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method. The trimmed mean target intensity of each array was arbitrarily set to 100.
