    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

    <Description>
The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift.  All cultures were grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.  Samples were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent, and total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (protocols available at www1.qiagen.com).  The RNA (10 Âµg) was then used as the template for cDNA synthesis, the product of which was fragmented, labelled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array, which was washed and scanned to obtain an image.  All of these steps were performed according to Affymetrix protocols (available at www.affymetrix.com).

    <Description>
The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift.  All cultures were grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.  Samples were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent, and total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (protocols available at www1.qiagen.com).  The RNA (10 Âµg) was then used as the template for cDNA synthesis, the product of which was fragmented, labelled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array, which was washed and scanned to obtain an image.  All of these steps were performed according to Affymetrix protocols (available at www.affymetrix.com).

The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift.  All cultures were grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.  Samples were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent, and total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (protocols available at www1.qiagen.com).  The RNA (10 Âµg) was then used as the template for cDNA synthesis, the product of which was fragmented, labelled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array, which was washed and scanned to obtain an image.  All of these steps were performed according to Affymetrix protocols (available at www.affymetrix.com).

    <Description>
The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift.  All cultures were grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.  Samples were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent, and total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (protocols available at www1.qiagen.com).  The RNA (10 Âµg) was then used as the template for cDNA synthesis, the product of which was fragmented, labelled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array, which was washed and scanned to obtain an image.  All of these steps were performed according to Affymetrix protocols (available at www.affymetrix.com).

The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift.  All cultures were grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose.  Samples were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent, and total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (protocols available at www1.qiagen.com).  The RNA (10 Âµg) was then used as the template for cDNA synthesis, the product of which was fragmented, labelled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array, which was washed and scanned to obtain an image.  All of these steps were performed according to Affymetrix protocols (available at www.affymetrix.com).

    <Summary>
The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes of global gene expression in E. coli during an oxygen shift. All cultures were grown under aerobic or anaerobic conditions in M9 minimal media supplemented with glucose. Samples were RNA-stabilized using Qiagen RNAProtect Bacterial Reagent, and total RNA was isolated from exponentially growing cells using a Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (protocols available at www1.qiagen.com). The RNA (10 Âµg) was then used as the template for cDNA synthesis, the product of which was fragmented, labelled, and hybridized to an Affymetrix E. coli Antisense Genome Array, which was washed and scanned to obtain an image. All of these steps were performed according to Affymetrix protocols (available at www.affymetrix.com).
