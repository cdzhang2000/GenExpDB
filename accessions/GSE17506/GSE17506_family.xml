      <Treatment-Protocol>
One set of fermentations were exposed to 5 mM IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time. One set of fermentations were exposed to IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time. One set of fermentations were exposed to IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

    <Title>Serine hydroxamate and the transcriptome of high cell density recombinant E. coli MG1655</Title>

    <Summary>
For over 30 years, serine hydroxamate has been used to chemically stimulate a stringent response in Escherichia coli and other bacteria. These studies have elucidated numerous characteristics of the classical stringent response beyond the simple cellular response to an amino acid shortage, including phospholipid synthesis and protease up-regulation. In this study, the effects of a serine hydroxamate addition on high cell density recombinant E. coli were examined and compared to the effects of recombinant protein production to determine overlaps, as recombinant protein production stress has often been attributed to amino acid shortages.  Both the transcriptome and growth characteristics were evaluated and compared. The serine hydroxamate addition profoundly decreased the culture growth rate, whereas, recombinant protein production did not.  Conversely, the transcriptome profile of the recombinant E. coli cultures were relatively unaffected by the serine hydroxamate addition, yet recombinant protein production dramatically changed the transcriptome profile.  A subset of the classical stringent response genes were effected by the serine hydroxamate addition, whereas, recombinant protein production regulated numerous classical stringent response genes; however, not all.  The genes that were regulated by the serine hydroxamate addition include numerous fatty acid synthesis genes, in agreement with altered phospholipids synthesis reports. These results indicate that recombinant protein production and the stringent response have many overlapping responses; however, are far from identical.
It was hypothesized that recombinant protein production leads to a stringent response due to the high amino acid synthesis demands related to recombinant protein synthesis.  A comparison of the transcriptomes during recombinant protein production and a chemical imposed stringent response would assist with determining what portion of the “metabolic burden” associated with recombinant protein production is due to amino acid shortages. In this study, the transcriptome profiles of recombinant E. coli were examined and compared for the three culture conditions: 1) Normal growth, no external stress; 2) L-serine hydroxamate addition (to mediate a stringent response); and 3) IPTG-induction to produce the recombinant protein chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT). The transcriptome profiles from these three conditions were analyzed using Affymetrix Anti-sense E. coli GeneChip® microarrays.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
For the serine hydroxamate fermentations, cells were harvested immediately prior to the serine hydroxamate-addition (Time S0) and 1-hour post serine hydroxamate-addition (Time S1). For the IPTG-induced fermentations, cells were harvested immediately prior to the IPTG-addition (Time S0) and 1-hour post-induction (Time S1). For the uninduced (unstressed) fermentations, cells were harvested at Time S0 and Time S1, for which the timing was synchronized with the serine hydroxamate and IPTG fermentations based on OD for Time S0 and time for Time S1.  Each fermentation condition was repeated (two biological replicates). RNA from each biological replicates was purified and processed independently. Three biological replicates were obtained for the control condition (Time S0), since prior the serine hydroxamate- or IPTG- addition all fermentations were replicates.  Prior to DNA microarray hybridization, where only two biological replicates existed, one of the processed samples was divided into two technical replicates, resulting in three separate hybridized chips. All Time S1 samples contained three technical replicates from two biological duplicates, whereas the control Time S0 measurement contained three biological replicates.
