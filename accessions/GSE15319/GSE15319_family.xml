    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

Separate colonies of the UPEC isolate UTI89 grown on LB agar plates from a -80°C freezer stock were used to start overnight shaking cultures in MES-buffered LB broth (MES-LB, pH 5.0).   Each culture was then diluted 1:100 into 7 ml MES-LB with or without 3 mM ASN in loosely capped 20-by-150-mm borosilicate glass tubes and grown with shaking at 37°C.

Image processing using the GCRMA method for probe-level data was performed using the Bioconductor Package in the R statistical environment.  The CEL files were analyzed as a group, background corrected using GCRMA, normalized using quantile normalization, and summary measures for probe sets were obtained by median polish.

    <Title>Conditioning of uropathogenic Escherichia coli to nitrosative stress</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE15319</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19255192</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
While in transit within and between hosts, uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) encounter multiple stresses, including substantial levels of nitric oxide and reactive nitrogen intermediates.  Strains of UPEC become conditioned to high concentrations of acidified sodium nitrite (ASN), a model system used to generate nitrosative stress. We used microarrays to define the expression profile of UPEC that have been conditioned for growth in ASN.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Separate colonies of the UPEC isolate UTI89 grown on LB agar plates from a -80°C freezer stock were used to start overnight shaking cultures in MES-buffered LB broth (MES-LB, pH 5.0).   Each culture was then diluted 1:100 into 7 ml MES-LB with or without 3 mM ASN in loosely capped 20-by-150-mm borosilicate glass tubes and grown with shaking at 37°C.  Growth was monitored by optical density until OD600 = 1.5, at which point cultures were spun down, and pellets frozen at -80°C for at least 12 h.  RNA was extracted with hot phenol-chloroform and purified by CsCl centrifugation.  cDNA was synthesized, fragmented, and labeled for hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays.
