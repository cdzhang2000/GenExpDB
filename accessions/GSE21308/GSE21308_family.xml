Eight co-cultures of 50 mL were centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min. The resulting pellet was enriched for Tetrahymena cells containing ingested SL1344 since most uningested free bacteria were not pelleted and remained in suspension. The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC. Three biological replicates were used for each type of suspension. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only RNA of high quality was used for microarray hybridizations and RT-qPCR.

Preparation of labeled nucleotides and hybridization to arrays was carried out as described previously (Kyle et al., 2010) based on the method developed by Eriksson et al. (2003). Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

3 mL of Salmonella enterica SL1344 (MB282) was grown overnight in LB broth to stationary phase.  The culture was centrifuged at 11400 x G for 3 minutes in a bench top microcentrifuge. After removing the supernatant, Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit was used to extract DNA from the cell pellet using the manufacturer's protocol.  DNA quality was assessed using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.

Eight co-cultures of 50 mL were centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min. The resulting pellet was enriched for Tetrahymena cells containing ingested SL1344 since most uningested free bacteria were not pelleted and remained in suspension. The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC. Three biological replicates were used for each type of suspension. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only RNA of high quality was used for microarray hybridizations and RT-qPCR.

Preparation of labeled nucleotides and hybridization to arrays was carried out as described previously (Kyle et al., 2010) based on the method developed by Eriksson et al. (2003). Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.

Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

    <Data-Processing>
To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.

Eight co-cultures of 50 mL were centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min. The resulting pellet was enriched for Tetrahymena cells containing ingested SL1344 since most uningested free bacteria were not pelleted and remained in suspension. The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC. Three biological replicates were used for each type of suspension. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only RNA of high quality was used for microarray hybridizations and RT-qPCR.

Preparation of labeled nucleotides and hybridization to arrays was carried out as described previously (Kyle et al., 2010) based on the method developed by Eriksson et al. (2003). Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

    <Data-Processing>
To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.

Eight co-cultures of 50 mL were centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min. The resulting pellet was enriched for Tetrahymena cells containing ingested SL1344 since most uningested free bacteria were not pelleted and remained in suspension. The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC.

Eight co-cultures of 50 mL were centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min. The resulting pellet was enriched for Tetrahymena cells containing ingested SL1344 since most uningested free bacteria were not pelleted and remained in suspension. The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC. Three biological replicates were used for each type of suspension. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only RNA of high quality was used for microarray hybridizations and RT-qPCR.

Preparation of labeled nucleotides and hybridization to arrays was carried out as described previously (Kyle et al., 2010) based on the method developed by Eriksson et al. (2003). Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

3 mL of Salmonella enterica SL1344 (MB282) was grown overnight in LB broth to stationary phase.  The culture was centrifuged at 11400 x G for 3 minutes in a bench top microcentrifuge. After removing the supernatant, Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit was used to extract DNA from the cell pellet using the manufacturer's protocol.  DNA quality was assessed using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.

To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.

Eight co-cultures of 50 mL were centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min. The resulting pellet was enriched for Tetrahymena cells containing ingested SL1344 since most uningested free bacteria were not pelleted and remained in suspension. The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC. Three biological replicates were used for each type of suspension. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only RNA of high quality was used for microarray hybridizations and RT-qPCR.

Preparation of labeled nucleotides and hybridization to arrays was carried out as described previously (Kyle et al., 2010) based on the method developed by Eriksson et al. (2003). Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

3 mL of Salmonella enterica SL1344 (MB282) was grown overnight in LB broth to stationary phase.  The culture was centrifuged at 11400 x G for 3 minutes in a bench top microcentrifuge. After removing the supernatant, Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit was used to extract DNA from the cell pellet using the manufacturer's protocol.  DNA quality was assessed using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.

3 mL of Salmonella enterica SL1344 (MB282) was grown overnight in LB broth to stationary phase.  The culture was centrifuged at 11400 x G for 3 minutes in a bench top microcentrifuge. After removing the supernatant, Promega Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit was used to extract DNA from the cell pellet using the manufacturer's protocol.  DNA quality was assessed using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.

Preparation of labeled nucleotides and hybridization to arrays was carried out as described previously (Kyle et al., 2010) based on the method developed by Eriksson et al. (2003). Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
DNA was crossed–linked to slides by UV radiation. All cDNA solutions were adjusted to the same label concentration and were hybridized to the arrays overnight at 42ºC. For each experimental condition, cDNA was prepared from three replicate suspensions (biological replicates) and each cDNA was hybridized to three replicate arrays (technical replicates) at random among several slides.

    <Data-Processing>
To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.

Eight co-cultures of 50 mL were centrifuged at 800 x g for 2 min. The resulting pellet was enriched for Tetrahymena cells containing ingested SL1344 since most uningested free bacteria were not pelleted and remained in suspension. The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC. Three biological replicates were used for each type of suspension. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only RNA of high quality was used for microarray hybridizations and RT-qPCR.

The supernatant was quickly removed and the pellet was resuspended in ice cold lysis buffer (0.5% SDS, 19% ethanol and 1% phenol in H2O). The suspension containing lysed Tetrahymena was centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min at 4 ºC. The bacterial pellet was then stored at -80ºC until RNA extraction. RNA extraction was performed with the Promega SV Total RNA Isolation kit per the manufacturer’s specifications, except that bacterial pellets were first treated with 50 mg/mL of lysozyme (Fisherbrand). RNA from two different sources was used as control. The first control RNA was isolated from 50 mL of SL1344 cells incubated in sterile H2O at an OD600 of 0.2 for 3 h, similarly to the SL1344 cells mixed with Tetrahymena. The second control RNA was isolated from 20 mL of SL1344 cells grown to mid–log phase of growth in LB broth. Both suspensions were centrifuged at 3200 x g for 5 min. at 4 ºC followed by addition of lysis buffer and centrifugation as described above. Bacterial pellets were immediately stored at -80ºC. Three biological replicates were used for each type of suspension. RNA integrity was assessed with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and only RNA of high quality was used for microarray hybridizations and RT-qPCR.

Preparation of labeled nucleotides and hybridization to arrays was carried out as described previously (Kyle et al., 2010) based on the method developed by Eriksson et al. (2003). Briefly, 20µg RNA from co-cultures and controls was reverse transcribed and Cy3-dCTP (GE Healthcare) incorporated into cDNA using the Fairplay III Microarray Labeling Kit (Stratagene). 2 µg of SL1344 genomic DNA was labeled with Cy5-dCTP (GE Healthcare) using Klenow (New England Biolabs) and served as the reference signal on the arrays. Labeling efficiency was determined with a Nanodrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific).

    <Data-Processing>
To address spatial dye effects or any disparity in amounts of spotted cDNA, data were normalized by setting the median log (Cy3/Cy5 ratio) of all of the spots on the same array to zero. Prior to analysis by Genespring, outliers among technical replicates were eliminated from the analysis with Dixon’s Q Test (critical value of 0.1) and remaining data were averaged.
