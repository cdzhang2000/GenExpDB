    <Manufacture-Protocol>
Oligonucleotide probes were prepared for all the protein-coding genes on the O157 Sakai genome (5,447 genes in total).  Principles for the probe design were 60-mer in length and one probe per gene/CDS.  For each gene, we designed 60-mer probe except one 44 or 45-mer probes for 7 genes.  In total, 5447 probes were synthesized (Sigma-Aldrich Japan, Tokyo, Japan), and each probe was spotted onto poly-L-Lysine coated glass slides (SD10011; Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) using SPBIO (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The labeled cDNA probes were then dissolved in water, mixed with hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA), and heat-denatured. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 16 h. Slides were washed with 2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 50 °C twice, then with 0.2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 20 °C twice.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The slides were scanned for fluorescence intensity using a GMS 418 array scanner (Genetic Microsystems), and the information was converted to 16-bit image files.

    <Description>
no additional information
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The signal density of each spot was quantified using IMAGENE software (BioDiscovery). We first corrected the intensity of each spot by subtracting the local background. The mean values of the negative control spots containing yeast oligo DNA and the spots containing spotting buffer alone were determined, with the standard deviation (SD). Normalization was performed using Intensity dependent (Lowess) normalization procedure in GeneSpring GX software.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The labeled cDNA probes were then dissolved in water, mixed with hybridization buffer (5x SSC, 0.5% SDS, 1 mg/ml yeast RNA), and heat-denatured. Hybridization was carried out at 50 °C for 16 h. Slides were washed with 2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 50 °C twice, then with 0.2x SSC containing 0.2% SDS at 20 °C twice.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The slides were scanned for fluorescence intensity using a GMS 418 array scanner (Genetic Microsystems), and the information was converted to 16-bit image files.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The signal density of each spot was quantified using IMAGENE software (BioDiscovery). We first corrected the intensity of each spot by subtracting the local background. The mean values of the negative control spots containing yeast oligo DNA and the spots containing spotting buffer alone were determined, with the standard deviation (SD). Normalization was performed using Intensity dependent (Lowess) normalization procedure in GeneSpring GX software.

    <Title>Transcriptomic analysis for response of EHEC  to short chain fatty acids</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE12903</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19202100</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) is an emerging pathogen that causes diarrhea and heamolytic uremic syndrome. Expression of genes associated to pathogenicity is strictly regulated by environmental factors. Since short chian fatty acids (SCFAs) are present in intestinal tract which is a target of EHEC infection, we investigated the response of EHEC genes to SCFAs, such as acetate, propionate and butyrate.

Keywords: Culture condition
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
3 sets of comparison between transcription profiles in EHEC growing in the presence of acetate, propionate or butyrate against EHEC growing in the presence of NaCl. Labelling of cDNA and hybridization were performed twice with independently prepared RNAs.
