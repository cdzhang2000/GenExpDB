    <Description>
Sigma-Genosys Panorama E. coli Gene Arrays. Each Panorama array contains PCR-amplified open reading frames (ORFs) from the E. coli K-12 (MG1655) genome. The majority of ORFs have been amplified from start to stop codon. All of the 4,290 ORFs have been printed in duplicate at 10 ng per spot onto positively charged nylon hybridization membranes.

    <Description>
To study the changes in gene expression after DNA damage in E. coli we used whole-genome gene arrays, containing all the annotated ORFs of E. coli.  Bacterial cultures were grown to early- to mid-log phase and mitomycin C (MMC) was added to the growth media.  Samples at several time points after induction of DNA damage were taken and total RNAs were purified from them.  Radiolabeled probes were generated by reverse transcription of purified RNAs with a mixture of all the gene-specific oligonucleotides used as primers. Following purification, the probes were hybridized to gene arrays.   In each experiment we compared the levels of expression of genes after the induction of DNA damage with their expression level before damage.

    <Description>
To study the changes in gene expression after DNA damage in E. coli we used whole-genome gene arrays, containing all the annotated ORFs of E. coli. Bacterial cultures were grown to early- to mid-log phase and mitomycin C (MMC) was added to the growth media. Samples at several time points after induction of DNA damage were taken and total RNAs were purified from them. Radiolabeled probes were generated by reverse transcription of purified RNAs with a mixture of all the gene-specific oligonucleotides used as primers. Following purification, the probes were hybridized to gene arrays. In each experiment we compared the levels of expression of genes after the induction of DNA damage with their expression level before damage.

    <Summary>
Changes in gene expression after treatment of E. coli cultures with mitomycin C were assessed using gene array technology. Unexpectedly, a large number of genes (nearly 30% of all genes) displayed significant changes in their expression level.  Analysis and classification of expression profiles of the corresponding genes allowed us to assign this large number of genes into a dozen to two dozen small clusters of genes with similar expression profiles.  This assignment allowed us to describe systematically the changes in the level of gene expression in response to DNA damage.  Among the damage-induced genes more than a hundred are novel.  From those genes involved in DNA metabolism that have not been previously shown to be induced by DNA damage, for example, the mutS gene involved in mismatch repair is especially noteworthy.  In addition to the SOS response, we observed the induction of other stress response pathways such as those of oxidative stress and osmotic protection.  Among the genes that are down-regulated in response to DNA damage are numerous protein biosynthesis genes. Analysis of the gene expression data highlighted the essential involvement of sigmaS regulated genes and the general stress response network in the response to DNA damage.
