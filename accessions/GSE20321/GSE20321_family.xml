S. Typhi strains were grown in 5 ml broth. 0.8 ml stop solution (5 % water saturated phenol in ethanol) was added and the suspension centrifuged at 7,700 g for 5 min at 4°C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 0.4 ml lysis solution (0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1mM EDTA 10mM, Tris/Cl pH = 8.0) and the suspension incubated at 25°C for 1 h. Next, 40 μl 10 % SDS was added and the solution heated to 65°C. After 2 min, 0.44 ml 1 M sodium acetate and 0.9 ml hot (65°C) phenol was added to the sample. The emulsion was incubated at 65°C for 6 min, chilled on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, extracted with 0.9 ml chloroform. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. After transferring the upper aqueous phase to a new tube, the RNA was precipitated by adding 80 μl 1 mM EDTA 3 M sodium acetate pH = 5.2 and 1 ml isopropanol. The samples were centrifuged for 30 min at 20,000 g at 4°C and the supernatant discarded. The RNA pellet was washed with 1 ml 80 % Ethanol and the samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 20,000 g at 4°C. RNA was air-dried and resuspended in RNase-free water. Traces of DNA in the RNA preparation were removed by DNase treatment (DNA-free DNase treatment, Applied Biosystems).

Comparison between viaB mutant and tviB-vexE mutant to assess effect of regulatory gene tviA on global gene expression
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For raw data processing and analysis, the TM4 Microarray Software Suite was used. Local background intensity was substracted from each itensity value. Raw expression data were normalized using a global Locfit/LOWESS algorithm.  Replicates on each replicate were combined by averaging the fold change of each gene.
Photomultiplier setting (HI: high intensity, LI low intensity): Data from both scans was processed (local background subtraction, normalization, in-slide replicates averaged). Then HI and LI were compared. If the intensity value of any channel (Ch1 or Ch2) in the high intensity scan was higher than 32000 (half of the maximum value), all information was replaced with that from the low intensity scan (values &lt;32000).

. Typhimurium strains were grown in 5 ml broth. 0.8 ml stop solution (5 % water saturated phenol in ethanol) was added and the suspension centrifuged at 7,700 g for 5 min at 4°C. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in 0.4 ml lysis solution (0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, 1mM EDTA 10mM, Tris/Cl pH = 8.0) and the suspension incubated at 25°C for 1 h. Next, 40 μl 10 % SDS was added and the solution heated to 65°C. After 2 min, 0.44 ml 1 M sodium acetate and 0.9 ml hot (65°C) phenol was added to the sample. The emulsion was incubated at 65°C for 6 min, chilled on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 20,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube, extracted with 0.9 ml chloroform. Phases were separated by centrifugation at 20,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. After transferring the upper aqueous phase to a new tube, the RNA was precipitated by adding 80 μl 1 mM EDTA 3 M sodium acetate pH = 5.2 and 1 ml isopropanol.

    <Description>
Comparison between a tviA expressing S. Typhimurium strain and the wild-type strain to assess effect of regulatory gene tviA on global gene expression.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For raw data processing and analysis, the TM4 Microarray Software Suite was used. Local background intensity was substracted from each itensity value. Raw expression data were normalized using a global Locfit/LOWESS algorithm. The dye flip (two technical replicates) was corrected (TM4 Microarray Software Suite).  Replicates on each array were combined by averaging the fold change of each gene.
Photomultiplier setting (HI: high intensity, LI low intensity): Data from both scans was processed (local background subtraction, normalization, in-slide replicates averaged). Then HI and LI were compared. If the intensity value of any channel (Ch1 or Ch2) in the high intensity scan was higher than 32000 (half of the maximum value), all information was replaced with that from the low intensity scan (values &lt;32000).

    <Summary>
Bacterial pathogens causing systemic disease commonly evolve from organisms associated with localized infections but differ from their close relatives in their ability to overcome mucosal barriers by mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. Here we investigated whether acquisition of a regulatory gene, tviA, contributed to the ability of Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi to disseminate from the intestine to systemic sites of infection during typhoid fever. To study the consequences of acquiring a new regulator by horizontal gene transfer, tviA was introduced into the chromosome of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium, a closely related pathogen causing a localized gastrointestinal infection in immunocompetent individuals. Modulation of gene expression by TviA in serotype Typhi and Typhimurium was determined by profiling and found to be very comparable. Expression of flagellin, a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP), was repressed by TviA when bacteria were grown at osmotic conditions encountered in tissue, but not at higher osmolarity present in the intestinal lumen. TviA-mediated flagellin repression enabled bacteria to evade sentinel functions of human model epithelia and resulted in increased bacterial dissemination to the spleen in a chicken model. 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The effect of tviA on gene expression profiles in S. Typhimurium was determined by comparing a tviA expressing strain (IR715(pTVIA1) with a control strain harboring the empty cloning plasmid (IR715 (WSK29). S. Typhimurium strains were cultured in SOB broth (low salt), a condition known to induce expression of TviA. Total RNA was extracted from one cultures of each strain. cDNA was differentially labeled with Alexa Fluor 555 and 648 (including a technical replicate in which the labeling of the samples was inversed [flip dye]), respectively and competitively hybridized on S.Typhimurium arrays (PFGRC, version 4). GSM509223 has 4 GPR files which are technical replicates of a competitive hybridization of cDNA from IR715(pWSK29) and IR715(pTVIA1). The profiles obtained from S. Typhimurium was compared with the corresponding data set for S. Typhi (comparing a (delta)tviB-vexE (tviBCDEvexABCDE) mutant and a (delta)viaB (tviABCDEvexABCDE) mutant) from GEO accession number GSE15752.
