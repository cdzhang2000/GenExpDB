1.	To 20-50g of total RNA (or 2g poly(A) RNA), add necessary control RNA mixture and 2l of oligo(dT) primer (0.5g/l ).  Make the final volume up to 31L with RNase-free water.  For human and mouse RNA samples, 20g of total RNA is sufficient for hybridization in ASP.  For Drosophila RNA sample, 50 g of total RNA is needed for ASP.  For less amount of RNA, hybridization should be performed mannually in a smaller volume of hybridization buffer.
2.	Mix well and incubate at 70 C for 10 minutes.  Chill on ice for 1 min. Spin briefly.
3.	Add followings to the RNA solution:
5X First Strand buffer		10L
0.1 M DTT			5L
Rnasin				1L
50X aminoallyl-dNTP mix	1L
SuperScript II (200U/L)		2L
4.	Mix and incubate at 42 °C for 1 hr.  Add additional 1l of superscript II and incubate for another 1 hr.
5.	To hydrolyze RNA, add 16.5l of 1 M NaOH and 16.5l of 0.5 M EDTA.  Mix and incubate at 65 °C for 15 minutes.  Add 16.5L of 1 M HCl to neutralize pH. 
6.	Clean-up the cDNA reaction with Microcon YM-30 (Cat No. 42409)
7.	Dry sample in a speed vac. Add D.W. and 1M sodium carbonate buffer to resuspend cDNA pellet in 9.0ul of 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer
8.	Add 2.0L of the appropriate NHS-ester Cy dye
9.	Incubate the reaction for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature.
10.	Clean up the coupling reaction with QIAquick PCR purification kit.  Repeat the elution step twice with 30L elution buffer to get 60L of elution volumn. 
11.	Calculate the pmole nucleotide, pmole Cy3, Cy5, and nucleotide/dye ratio. (Determine O.D. at 260nm, 550nm, 650nm, and 700nm.)
12.	Dry the Cy3 and Cy5 sample in a speed vac. and proceed to hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
1.	Dissolve the dried labeled sample in a reasonable volume of hybridization buffer depending on the area to be covered. (Typically, 22X22mm cover-slip requires 25 ㎕ of hybridization buffer.  22X60mm cover-slip requires 60 ㎕).
2.	Heat the labeled sample preparation for 5min at 95℃.
3.	Spin down for 30 sec.  Do not put on ice!!!
4.	Place slide in the hybridization chamber. Put 20㎕ of 3XSSC to the chamber at both ends of the slide. 
5.	Pipette the labeled target onto the slide surface.
6.	Carefully place the cover-slip on top of the slide. Try to reduce the formation of air bubbles.
7.	Seal the hybridization chamber and incubate in 42℃. Water-bath or hybridization oven for more than 16 hr.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The medium for continuous culture contained 20 g LB, 9 g glucose, 10 g NaHCO3, 50 mg ampicillin per liter and isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was supplemented to be 0.1 mM. The initial pH of the medium was set to be pH 7.3 by adding 1 N HCl solution. The inoculation culture was transferred into a 250 mL-fermentor containing 100 mL medium (Small scale multi-chemostat fermentor; Biotron Inc., Bucheon, Korea). The culture was performed at 37 C, 350 rpm with flushing CO2 gas at 20 mL/min. After 8 h inoculation, the feeding and outlet pumps were started at flow rate of 0.166 mL/h (dilution rate = 0.1 h-1).

      <Label-Protocol>
1.	To 20-50g of total RNA (or 2g poly(A) RNA), add necessary control RNA mixture and 2l of oligo(dT) primer (0.5g/l ).  Make the final volume up to 31L with RNase-free water.  For human and mouse RNA samples, 20g of total RNA is sufficient for hybridization in ASP.  For Drosophila RNA sample, 50 g of total RNA is needed for ASP.  For less amount of RNA, hybridization should be performed mannually in a smaller volume of hybridization buffer.
2.	Mix well and incubate at 70 C for 10 minutes.  Chill on ice for 1 min. Spin briefly.
3.	Add followings to the RNA solution:
5X First Strand buffer		10L
0.1 M DTT			5L
Rnasin				1L
50X aminoallyl-dNTP mix	1L
SuperScript II (200U/L)		2L
4.	Mix and incubate at 42 °C for 1 hr.  Add additional 1l of superscript II and incubate for another 1 hr.
5.	To hydrolyze RNA, add 16.5l of 1 M NaOH and 16.5l of 0.5 M EDTA.  Mix and incubate at 65 °C for 15 minutes.  Add 16.5L of 1 M HCl to neutralize pH. 
6.	Clean-up the cDNA reaction with Microcon YM-30 (Cat No. 42409)
7.	Dry sample in a speed vac. Add D.W. and 1M sodium carbonate buffer to resuspend cDNA pellet in 9.0ul of 0.1M sodium carbonate buffer
8.	Add 2.0L of the appropriate NHS-ester Cy dye
9.	Incubate the reaction for 1 hour in the dark at room temperature.
10.	Clean up the coupling reaction with QIAquick PCR purification kit.  Repeat the elution step twice with 30L elution buffer to get 60L of elution volumn. 
11.	Calculate the pmole nucleotide, pmole Cy3, Cy5, and nucleotide/dye ratio. (Determine O.D. at 260nm, 550nm, 650nm, and 700nm.)
12.	Dry the Cy3 and Cy5 sample in a speed vac. and proceed to hybridization step.
