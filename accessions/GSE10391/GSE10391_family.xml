      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted in multiple stress medium at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted in multiple stress medium at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted in multiple stress medium at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Characteristics>
Multiple stressed for 2 days
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Source>M. tuberculosis H37Rv grown without multiple stress in normal Dubos medium (pH7.0) with glycerol until OD600=0.2.</Source>
      <Organism taxid="83332">Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv</Organism>
      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted in multiple stress medium at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

Cells were harvested and quickly frozen in a dry ice-ethanol both. Total RNA was isolated using glass beads (Bio101, Lysing Matrix B), a TRIzol (InVitrogen) extraction and purified by Rneasy (Qiagen) kit according to the manufacturers' recommendations.
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Cy5</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Characteristics>
Multiple stressed for 3 days
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Characteristics>
Multiple stressed for 3 days
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Source>M. tuberculosis H37Rv grown without multiple stress in normal Dubos medium (pH7.0) with glycerol until OD600=0.2.</Source>
      <Organism taxid="83332">Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv</Organism>
      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted in multiple stress medium at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

Multiple stressed for 6 days
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted in multiple stress medium at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

Multiple stressed for 6 days
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted in multiple stress medium at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Characteristics>
Multiple stressed for 12 days
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL standard multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. The standard multiple stress medium was prepared by mixing 1X Dubos Broth base and 10% (v/v) albumin supplement at pH5.0, finally comprising 0.75% Dextrose, 0.5% BSA, and 0.85% NaCl in acidic condition. No glycerol was added in the multiple stress medium except 0.02% (v/v) Tween 80. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Organism taxid="83332">Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv</Organism>
      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted into modified multiple stress medium (10% DUBOS, pH5.0) at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared as follows: 10 μg of total RNA and 2 μg of random oligonucleotide hexamers (Invitrogen, CA) were incubated 15 min at 65 °C, cooled on ice, combined with Stratascript RTase buffer, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.02 mM dUTP, 1.5 nmol aminoallyl-dUTP (Amersham, NJ), and 2 μl Stratascript RTase II (Invitrogen, CA) in a total volume of 30 μl. This mixture was incubated 10 min at room temperature, and 42 °C overnight. Synthesized cDNA was purified by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendation. The aminoallyl-dUTP-conjugated cDNA probes was spin-dried (SpeedVac, Savant), resuspended in 50 mM sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and cyanine monofunctional dyes (Amersham) for 1 h at room temperature followed by quenching with 4 M hydoxylamine. Cyanine-labeled probes were purified again by QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 3, 9, and 18 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL one tenth water dilution of the acidic multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. To achieve more stringent starvation, one tenth water dilution of the acidic multiple stress medium was used with the supplemental surfactant (0.018% (v/v) Tyloxapol) at pH5.0. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL one tenth water dilution of the acidic multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. To achieve more stringent starvation, one tenth water dilution of the acidic multiple stress medium was used with the supplemental surfactant (0.018% (v/v) Tyloxapol) at pH5.0. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. The bottles were sealed with a rubber septum flip top cap, and molten paraffin wax on the outside of the cap to ensure air-tight. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted into normal but diluted DUBOS medium (10% DUBOS, pH7.0) at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Organism taxid="83332">Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv</Organism>
      <Characteristics>
Reference cells diluted into normal but diluted DUBOS medium (10% DUBOS, pH7.0) at day 0.
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once the seed culture reached the above OD600 (OD600=0.2), part of the cell culture was harvested, and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80C. The total RNA isolated from each harvest cells served as control in the microarray hybridization.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Wild-type M. tuberculosis H37RV was grown in the complete normal Dubos medium supplemented with 1.5% glycerol at pH7.0. The cells were incubated in vented cap bottles aerobically at 37C until OD600 reached to 0.2. To synchronize growth before inoculation, cells were diluted in the same medium and grown again until OD600 value of 0.2 before harvest (i.e. seed culture for microarray control sets).

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cells were harvested after 3, 9, and 18 days incubation under the given multiple stresses. After centrifugation, cells were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The seed culture for microarray control sets was collected by centrifugation, and resuspended with 150 mL one tenth water dilution of the multiple stress medium to recover the original OD600 (OD600=0.2) in a 1 liter glass bottle with a 24/40 standard joint neck. To achieve starvation stress only, one tenth water dilution of the multiple stress medium was used with the supplemental surfactant (0.018% (v/v) Tyloxapol) at pH7.0. The head air space in each bottle was replaced every other day for 5 minutes with gas mixture (5% O2, 10% CO2 and 85 % N2) passing through a 0.2 um filter attached to a 18-G needle. Sealed culture bottles were rolled in a roller incubator at 37C.

    <Title>In vitro dormancy achieved by multiple stresses in Mycobacterium tuberculosis</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE10391</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19562030</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The human pathogen, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, develops a dormant infection, in which organisms survive within the body. We established a unique in vitro dormancy model based on the characterization of drug-resistance to INH and rifampin. M. tuberculosis cells were maintained in controlled and defined multiple stress conditions with low oxygen (5% dissolved oxygen tension), acid (pH 5.) along with glycerol-deprived medium conditions. To monitor gene expression changes in M. tuberculosis in response to the multiple stresses, we performed microarray analysis at the time point of 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12days after treatment. M. tuberculosis adapting to multiple stresses displayed characteristics associated with persistence in vivo, including entry into a non-replicative state and the repression of genes involved in energy regeneration. Under in vitro multiple-stresses, M. tuberculosis significantly modulated gene expression mainly in response to the starvation stresses. Cells exposed to these multiple stress conditions shows significant drug-resistance. Comparison with other in vivo expression profiles demonstrates induction of several common genes for in vitro dormancy conditions.
Keywords: Stress response in time course.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Samples under multiple stress condition were taken at day 1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 for microarray hybridization. More than two technical replicates per biological samples with Cy3/5 dye-swaps.
