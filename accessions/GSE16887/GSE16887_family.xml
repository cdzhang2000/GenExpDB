2,857 70mer oligonucleotides were designed by and purchased from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. (Huntsville, AL, USA) to represent 2,857 ORFs from Listeria monocytogenes EGD. 70mer oligonucleotides were designed for 61 Listeria innocua ORFs (based on L. innocua Clip 11262) and five Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs (to serve as negative controls) using ArrayOligoSelector (http://arrayoligosel.sourceforge.net). Oligonucleotides were resuspended in 1X SSC + 0.0025% Sarkosyl to a final concentration of 25uM. All oligonucleotides and controls were spotted in duplicate on Corning UltraGAPS slides (Corning, NY, USA) using a custom built XYZ microarrayer (based on the original design of Pat Brown from Stanford University). Oligonucleotides were UV-crosslinked at 300mJ for 1 minute. Printing quality was checked using Cy3-labeled random sequence nonamers.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Cells were grown in BHI broth at 37°C with shaking (250 rpm; Series 25 Incubator Shaker, New Brunswick Scientific) unless otherwise indicated. All optical density measurements (OD) were made with a model DU640 spectrophotometer (Beckman). L. monocytogenes 10403S was streaked onto brain heart infusion (BHI) agar from –80°C glycerol stock cultures followed by incubation at 37°C for 24 h. A single colony was subsequently inoculated into a tube containing 5 ml BHI broth and grown overnight. 50 μl of this overnight culture was then added to a tube of 5 ml fresh, pre-warmed BHI broth and grown to logarithmic phase (OD600=0.4), then diluted 1:100 in fresh, pre-warmed BHI broth (50 μl into 5 ml broth). After growth to OD600=0.4, NaCl was added (to achieve a final concentration of 0.3M NaCl). After incubation at 37°C for 10 min with shaking, a 2X volume of RNAProtect Bacteria Reagent (Qiagen) were added to cells to stabilize RNA, vortexed, and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Cells were then pelleted by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 5 min (Avanti J-25 Centrifuge, Beckman). Supernatant was removed and cell pellets were stored at -80°C until RNA isolation.

RNA was extracted and DNase treated using Ambion RiboPureTM -Bacteria Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total nucleic acid concentrations and purity was assessed using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Rockland, DE). RNA quality was analyzed using the 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies; Santa Clara, CA) and only RNA of excellent integrity (RNA integrity number of ≥8) was used.

cDNA was synthesized from purified total RNA and labeled with Alexa Fluor dyes using the SuperScript Plus Indirect cDNA Labeling System according to the manufacturer's protocol with following modifications. 6 μg total RNA was combined with 3μg random primers, incubated at 70°C for 10 min. Following a 5 min on ice, 6 μl 5X First-Strand buffer, 1.5 μl 0.1M dithiothreitol (DTT), 1.5 μl dNTP mix containing aminoallyl-dATP and aminohexyl-dTTP, 1 μl RNaseOUT and 2 μl SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase were added to the reaction tube. The reverse transcription reaction was carried out at 42ºC overnight. Remaining RNA was hydrolyzed by addition of 15 μl 1N NaOH (70ºC for 10 min) and then neutralized with 15 μl 1N HCl. Each cDNA sample was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) using RNase-free water for the final elution step. cDNA samples were dried in a SpeedVac until reduced to ~3 μl. Each cDNA sample was combined with 2X Coupling Buffer and then added to a vial of DMSO-suspended CyTM Dye (GE Healthcare) and the dye coupling reaction was carried out at room temperature for 1h. Labeled cDNA samples were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit with an additional 35% Guanidine-HCl wash step and a final elution step in RNase-free water. Purified, labeled cDNA was quantified with UV spectrophotometer readings at wavelengths appropriate to determine the frequency of incorporation (FOI), which is defined as the number of labeled nucleotides incorporated per 1,000 nucleotides of cDNA. cDNA samples with FOIs between 20-50 were used for microarray hybridization.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Microarray slide blocking was performed prior to hybridization. Slides were immersed in blocking solution (1% BSA, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 42°C. After 1 h, the slides were washed for 5 min in 0.1x SSC twice, followed by 30 sec in deionized water and then dried by centrifugation. For the strains to be compared, labeled cDNAs were combined and dried, then suspended in 50μl of hybridization buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.5X formamide, 0.06 μg/μl salmon sperm DNA in DEPC-treated water). Samples were vortexed for 1 min and denatured at 95°C for 5 min (repeated twice), followed by a brief centrifugation, then applied to the slides using mSeries LifterSlips™ (Erie Scientific). Following overnight hybridization at 42°C, the slides were washed in 2X SSC+0.1% SDS (5 min, 42˚C), with subsequent 5-min washes at room temperature in 2X SSC+0.1% SDS, 2X SSC, and 0.2X SSC, followed by final rinse in deionized water. Slides were dried by centrifugation.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
Expression profiles were measured for 4 independent biological replicates. Array data were analyzed using a one way ANOVA model to compare differences between strains, and a two way ANOVA model to identify genes regulated by L. mono untreated and L. mono treated. 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Analyses of microarray data were performed in R with Bioconductor using LIMMA software (Smyth, 2005). For normalization within arrays, the data were weighted for the genomic DNA controls and normalized using print-tip loess method (Smyth &amp; Speed, 2003). The data were then scale normalized between arrays. The correlation between duplicate spots was calculated (Smyth et al., 2005) and a linear model was fitted to the normalized log ratios and empirical Bayes statistics were applied for differential expression analysis.

    <Summary>
The extensively studied intracellular pathogen, L. monocytogenes, is an ideal model for identifying small-molecule agents for treating bacterial infections. By selecting specific biological targets in L. monocytogenes, which are common to Gram-positive pathogens, we could extrapolate drug discovery information derived from this well-studied bacterium. Attenuating the pathogen’s virulence and stress response attributes without killing it, eliminates selective pressure caused by disruption of essential gene functions (as done by current antibiotics) and reduces the likelihood of developing microbes that are impervious to the effects of antibiotics. To this end, we have assessed multiple libraries of small organic compounds to identify inhibitors of L. monocytogenes σB, the alternative sigma factor common to several clinically relevant Gram-positive pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, and Bacillus anthracis. The role of σB as a transcriptional regulator of stress response and virulence makes it an ideal, well conserved target for chemotherapeutic development.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Independent RNA isolations were performed for each growth experiment (log phase cells exposed to BHI+0.3M NaCl and BHI+0.3M NaCl + CMPD). Four biological replicates were used in competitive whole-genome microarray experiments. For the hybridizations, RNA from the wildtype parent strain L. monocytogenes 10403S were hybridized to RNA from the wildtype parent strain 10403S treated with CMPD.
