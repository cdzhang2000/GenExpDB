      <Characteristics>
Schu 4
      </Characteristics>
      <Treatment-Protocol>
BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

      <Extract-Protocol>
At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was collected from each sample and passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 21,000 x g for 2 min.

      <Label-Protocol>
RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.

Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was collected from each sample and passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 21,000 x g for 2 min.

RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was collected from each sample and passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 21,000 x g for 2 min.

After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was collected from each sample and passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 21,000 x g for 2 min.

RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.

BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.

Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was collected from each sample and passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 21,000 x g for 2 min.

RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was collected from each sample and passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 21,000 x g for 2 min.

RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA).

Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise.

BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.

Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min.

RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
BMMs seeded in 12-well plates were infected with Schu S4 at a MOI of either 200 (0, 1, 2 and 4 h time points), 50 (8, 12 h time points) or 25 (16 and 24 h time points). The use of different MOIs in this experimental design was required to recover sufficient amount of bacterial RNA at all time points analyzed but did not affect the timing of the Francisella intracellular cycle, therefore generating biologically comparable samples. Time zero samples were generated by adding bacteria (MOI 200; 108/well) directly to BMMs that had been washed with PBS, followed by the immediate addition of lysis buffer, as described below. Uninfected controls were generated at both 0 and 24h post infection.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bone marrow cells were isolated from femurs of 6-10 week-old, C57BL/6J female mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and differentiated into macrophages for 5 days at 37°C and 7% CO2, in 1g/L glucose Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 10% L-conditioned medium {de Chastellier, 1993 #28}, and 2 mM L-glutamine in non tissue culture-treated Petri dishes. After 5 days, loosely adherent BMMs were washed with PBS, harvested by incubation in chilled cation-free PBS on ice for 10 min, resuspended in complete medium and replated in either 6-, 12- or 24-well cell culturetreated plates at a density of 1x106, 5x105 or 1x105 macrophages/well, respectively. BMMs were further incubated at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere for 48 h, with replenishing complete medium 24 h before infection. For infections, bacterial suspensions were diluted in complete medium and 1.5, 1 or 0.5 ml was added to chilled BMMs at an appropriate multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50, unless stated otherwise. Bacteria were centrifuged onto macrophages at 400 x g for 10 min at 4°C, and infected BMMs incubated for 20 min at 37°C under 7% CO2 atmosphere including an initial, rapid warm up in a 37°C water bath to synchronize bacterial uptake. Infected BMMs were 23 then washed 5 times with DMEM to remove extracellular bacteria, incubated for an additional 60 min in complete medium containing 100 μg/ml gentamicin to kill extracellular bacteria and thereafter in gentamicin-free medium until processing.

At each time point, samples were washed 3 times with sterile PBS to remove residual extracellular bacteria, and both BMMs and bacteria were lysed directly in the wells by the addition of 1 ml TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and pipetting 10 times. Samples were transferred to microtubes, 200 ìl chloroform were added, vials were vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 15 min. The RNA-containing aqueous phase was collected from each sample and passed through a Qiashredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 21,000 x g for 2 min.

RNA amplification step was introduced as follows: all RNA samples that were generated from F. tularensis SchuS4-infected and noninfected BMMs were randomized on a single 96-well plate and the MessageAmp II-Bacteria kit (Ambion, Foster City, CA) was used to amplify 0.5 to 1 μg of mixture of F. tularensis and BMM RNAs according to manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, RNAs were concentrated to 5 μl, denatured for 10 min at 70°C, polyadenylated using E.coli polyA polymerase for 15 min at 37°C, and reverse transcribed for 2 h at 42°C using ArrayScript and polydT primer with a T7 tail.  Second strand synthesis was performed immediately after first strand cDNA synthesis for 2 h at 16°C. Purified cDNA was mixed with 75 nmol of biotin-16-UTP (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) and concentrated to 18 μl. Biotin-labeled complementary pathogen-host RNA was amplified at 37°C in an overnight 40 μl in vitro transcription reaction. The amount of target consisting of macrophage and F. tularensis cRNAs was determined by Absorbance measurements at 260 nm. The quality and the size of the amplified targets were determined on a Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Pico analysis kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA). The amount of F. tularensis cRNA was estimated by quantitative RT-PCR of the FTT0243 locus, as described below, using a standard curve method (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). F.tularensis RNA extracted from a bacterial suspension in TSB-C was used for the RNA standard curve.

    <Summary>
The highly infectious bacterium Francisella tularensis is a facultative intracellular pathogen, whose virulence requires proliferation inside host cells, including macrophages. Although some Francisella determinants of intracellular growth have been identified, much remains to be understood about the pathogenesis of this organism. In particular, how Francisella responds to its intracellular environment could provide clues about its intracellular biology and reveal pathogenic determinants based on their intracellular expression profiles. Here we have performed a global transcriptional profiling of the highly virulent F. tularensis subsp. tularensis Schu S4 strain during its intracellular cycle within primary murine macrophages. Phagocytosed bacteria rapidly responded to their intracellular environment and progressively altered their transcriptional profile over time. Differential gene expression profiles were revealed that correlated with specific intracellular locations of the bacteria. Upregulation of general and oxidative stress response genes was a hallmark of the early phagosomal and late endosomal stages, while induction of a subset of transport and metabolic genes characterized the cytosolic replication stages. Expression of the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI) genes, the functions of which are associated with intracellular proliferation, increased during the intracellular cycle. Similarly, 27 chromosomal loci putatively encoding hypothetical, secreted, outer membrane proteins or transcriptional regulators were identified as upregulated during the intracellular cycle. In-frame deletion of FTT0383, the Schu S4 ortholog of fevR, of FTT0369c or FTT1676 abolished the ability of Schu S4 to either survive or proliferate intracellularly, demonstrating that bacterial factors of intracellular pathogenesis can be identified based on their intracellular expression profile. In conclusion, establishing the intracellular transcriptome of Francisella has revealed important aspects of its intracellular biology and identified novel virulence determinants of this pathogen.
