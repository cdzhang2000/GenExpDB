    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

      <Extract-Protocol>
The RNeasy Mini Purification Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was used to extract total RNA from E. coli O157:H7 cultures.  RNAlater Stabilization Reagent (1.2 ml) (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was combined with 0.6 ml E. coli O157:H7.  After 10 min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 x g for 10 min under refrigeration.  The supernatant was decanted and the bacterial pellet was stored at -70Â°C until further processed (2-10 h).
One hundred Âµl tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, ph 8.0; Promega; Madison, WI) containing lysozyme (3 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was added to each cell pellet.  The pellet was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  Buffer RLT (350 Âµl) was combined with the tris-EDTA/lysozyme cell suspension to further lyse cells.  The total volume was combined with 250 Âµl of 200 proof ethanol (Aaper Alcohol; Shelbyville, KY) to solubilize the cell lysate, and the entire sample was transferred to the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a collection tube and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec at room temperature.  The silica-based membrane efficiently binds up to 100 Âµg of RNA longer than 200 bases.  The collection tube and eluate were discarded, and the spin column was placed in a new collection tube.  Buffer RW1 (700 Âµl) was applied to the column, centrifuged, and flow-through was discarded as described previously.  Twice, 500 Âµl of buffer RPE was applied to the spin column allowing 5 min prior to centrifugation at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The spin column was placed in a 1.5 ml collection tube that was used for long-term storage.  In order to elute RNA from the spin column, 30 Âµl RNase-free water was applied directly to the membrane and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The RNA eluate was stored at -80Â°C until evaluated for quantity, quality, and purity.

Stationary phase growth (24hr) ~8 log CFU/ml was centrifuged at 8000xg 4C and resuspended in Luria-Bertaini broth with 0.5% (w/v) sodium benozate

      <Extract-Protocol>
The RNeasy Mini Purification Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was used to extract total RNA from E. coli O157:H7 cultures.  RNAlater Stabilization Reagent (1.2 ml) (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was combined with 0.6 ml E. coli O157:H7.  After 10 min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 x g for 10 min under refrigeration.  The supernatant was decanted and the bacterial pellet was stored at -70Â°C until further processed (2-10 h).
One hundred Âµl tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, ph 8.0; Promega; Madison, WI) containing lysozyme (3 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was added to each cell pellet.  The pellet was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  Buffer RLT (350 Âµl) was combined with the tris-EDTA/lysozyme cell suspension to further lyse cells.  The total volume was combined with 250 Âµl of 200 proof ethanol (Aaper Alcohol; Shelbyville, KY) to solubilize the cell lysate, and the entire sample was transferred to the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a collection tube and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec at room temperature.  The silica-based membrane efficiently binds up to 100 Âµg of RNA longer than 200 bases.  The collection tube and eluate were discarded, and the spin column was placed in a new collection tube.  Buffer RW1 (700 Âµl) was applied to the column, centrifuged, and flow-through was discarded as described previously.  Twice, 500 Âµl of buffer RPE was applied to the spin column allowing 5 min prior to centrifugation at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The spin column was placed in a 1.5 ml collection tube that was used for long-term storage.  In order to elute RNA from the spin column, 30 Âµl RNase-free water was applied directly to the membrane and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The RNA eluate was stored at -80Â°C until evaluated for quantity, quality, and purity.

After 10 min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 x g for 10 min under refrigeration.  The supernatant was decanted and the bacterial pellet was stored at -70Â°C until further processed (2-10 h).
One hundred Âµl tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, ph 8.0; Promega; Madison, WI) containing lysozyme (3 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was added to each cell pellet.  The pellet was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  Buffer RLT (350 Âµl) was combined with the tris-EDTA/lysozyme cell suspension to further lyse cells.  The total volume was combined with 250 Âµl of 200 proof ethanol (Aaper Alcohol; Shelbyville, KY) to solubilize the cell lysate, and the entire sample was transferred to the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a collection tube and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec at room temperature.  The silica-based membrane efficiently binds up to 100 Âµg of RNA longer than 200 bases.  The collection tube and eluate were discarded, and the spin column was placed in a new collection tube.  Buffer RW1 (700 Âµl) was applied to the column, centrifuged, and flow-through was discarded as described previously.  Twice, 500 Âµl of buffer RPE was applied to the spin column allowing 5 min prior to centrifugation at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The spin column was placed in a 1.5 ml collection tube that was used for long-term storage.  In order to elute RNA from the spin column, 30 Âµl RNase-free water was applied directly to the membrane and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The RNA eluate was stored at -80Â°C until evaluated for quantity, quality, and purity.

The RNeasy Mini Purification Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was used to extract total RNA from E. coli O157:H7 cultures.  RNAlater Stabilization Reagent (1.2 ml) (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was combined with 0.6 ml E. coli O157:H7.  After 10 min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 x g for 10 min under refrigeration.  The supernatant was decanted and the bacterial pellet was stored at -70Â°C until further processed (2-10 h).
One hundred Âµl tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, ph 8.0; Promega; Madison, WI) containing lysozyme (3 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was added to each cell pellet.  The pellet was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  Buffer RLT (350 Âµl) was combined with the tris-EDTA/lysozyme cell suspension to further lyse cells.  The total volume was combined with 250 Âµl of 200 proof ethanol (Aaper Alcohol; Shelbyville, KY) to solubilize the cell lysate, and the entire sample was transferred to the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a collection tube and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec at room temperature.  The silica-based membrane efficiently binds up to 100 Âµg of RNA longer than 200 bases.  The collection tube and eluate were discarded, and the spin column was placed in a new collection tube.  Buffer RW1 (700 Âµl) was applied to the column, centrifuged, and flow-through was discarded as described previously.  Twice, 500 Âµl of buffer RPE was applied to the spin column allowing 5 min prior to centrifugation at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The spin column was placed in a 1.5 ml collection tube that was used for long-term storage.  In order to elute RNA from the spin column, 30 Âµl RNase-free water was applied directly to the membrane and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The RNA eluate was stored at -80Â°C until evaluated for quantity, quality, and purity.

      <Extract-Protocol>
The RNeasy Mini Purification Kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was used to extract total RNA from E. coli O157:H7 cultures.  RNAlater Stabilization Reagent (1.2 ml) (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) was combined with 0.6 ml E. coli O157:H7.  After 10 min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 8000 x g for 10 min under refrigeration.  The supernatant was decanted and the bacterial pellet was stored at -70Â°C until further processed (2-10 h).
One hundred Âµl tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, ph 8.0; Promega; Madison, WI) containing lysozyme (3 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was added to each cell pellet.  The pellet was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  Buffer RLT (350 Âµl) was combined with the tris-EDTA/lysozyme cell suspension to further lyse cells.  The total volume was combined with 250 Âµl of 200 proof ethanol (Aaper Alcohol; Shelbyville, KY) to solubilize the cell lysate, and the entire sample was transferred to the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a collection tube and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec at room temperature.  The silica-based membrane efficiently binds up to 100 Âµg of RNA longer than 200 bases.  The collection tube and eluate were discarded, and the spin column was placed in a new collection tube.  Buffer RW1 (700 Âµl) was applied to the column, centrifuged, and flow-through was discarded as described previously.  Twice, 500 Âµl of buffer RPE was applied to the spin column allowing 5 min prior to centrifugation at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The spin column was placed in a 1.5 ml collection tube that was used for long-term storage.  In order to elute RNA from the spin column, 30 Âµl RNase-free water was applied directly to the membrane and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The RNA eluate was stored at -80Â°C until evaluated for quantity, quality, and purity.

One hundred Âµl tris-EDTA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl, 1 mM EDTA, ph 8.0; Promega; Madison, WI) containing lysozyme (3 mg/ml; Sigma-Aldrich; St. Louis, MO) was added to each cell pellet.  The pellet was thoroughly mixed and incubated at room temperature for 10 min.  Buffer RLT (350 Âµl) was combined with the tris-EDTA/lysozyme cell suspension to further lyse cells.  The total volume was combined with 250 Âµl of 200 proof ethanol (Aaper Alcohol; Shelbyville, KY) to solubilize the cell lysate, and the entire sample was transferred to the RNeasy Mini Spin Column in a collection tube and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec at room temperature.  The silica-based membrane efficiently binds up to 100 Âµg of RNA longer than 200 bases.  The collection tube and eluate were discarded, and the spin column was placed in a new collection tube.  Buffer RW1 (700 Âµl) was applied to the column, centrifuged, and flow-through was discarded as described previously.  Twice, 500 Âµl of buffer RPE was applied to the spin column allowing 5 min prior to centrifugation at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The spin column was placed in a 1.5 ml collection tube that was used for long-term storage.  In order to elute RNA from the spin column, 30 Âµl RNase-free water was applied directly to the membrane and centrifuged at 8000 x g for 15 sec.  The RNA eluate was stored at -80Â°C until evaluated for quantity, quality, and purity.

    <Title>Transcription analysis of E. coli O157:H7 when exposed to sodium benzoate</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE17519</Accession>
    <Summary>
Sodium benzoate is a widely used food antimicrobial in drinks and fruit juices. A microarray study was conducted to determine the transcriptional response of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to 0.5% (w/v) sodium benzoate.  Stationary phase E. coli O157:H7 grown in 150 ml Luria-Bertani broth (LB) was exposed to 0 (control) and 0.5% sodium benzoate. Each treatment was duplicated and sampled at 0 (immediately after exposure), 5, 15, 30, and 60 min. Total RNA was extracted and analyzed with E. coli 2.0 Gene Chips.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Completely randomized design with 0% (control) and 0.5% (w/v) sodium benzoate treated cells were exposed for 0 (immediately after exposure), 5 min, 15 min, 30 min, and 60 min.  Each experiment was replicated once and total RNA was extracted and Affymetrix prokaryotic protocol was followed to hybridize cDNA onto E. coli Genome 2.0 Arrays.
