      <Organism taxid="1773">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</Organism>
      <Characteristics>
recombinant strain TB294-pSigA, contains an extrachromosomal plasmid that overexpresses the sigma factor A gene from the hsp60 promoter. Strain is derived from TB294, which is a clinical isolate of strain 210, and a member of the W-Beijing family of M. tuberculosis strains.
      </Characteristics>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Bacteria were grown in monocytes as follows. Prior to infection, the human monocytic cell line MonoMac6 was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 9 ug/ml of bovine insulin. The cells were then infected with single-cell suspensions of M. tuberculosis in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated human serum at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1. Infected monocytes were incubated at 37 ˚C in 5% CO2.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
At 6 days after infection, the supernatant was aspirated from the infected monocytes, and the monocytes were lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer (2 M guanidine isothiocyanate, 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 300 mM LiCl, 10 mM EDTA) per 106 cells. After sonication for 10 seconds with an ultrasonic cell disrupter, the suspension was centrifuged at 7000 g for 10 min to pellet the bacilli. The pellet was washed with the extraction buffer.  To disrupt the bacteria and extract the RNA, samples were transferred to Lysing Matrix B tubes (BIO 101)  containing RNAzol B (TEL-TEST) and were agitated using a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101).  Chloroform extraction was performed to remove proteins and DNA and then the RNA was precipitated using isopropanol. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, resuspended in DEPC-water and then any remaining chromosomal DNA was removed with “DNA-free” treatment and removal reagents (Ambion). The bacterial RNA was further purified with the MICROBEnrich kit (Ambion) which removes eukaryotic RNA.  RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
II.  Prehybridization
1.  Prepare Prehybridization Solution (Fresh Each Time)
**this volume is based on a glass dish with a base measurement of 11x8cm.  This dish allows for a pre-hyb of 1-4 slides.  Adjust volume accordingly based on size of dish and/or number of slides.
	106.0ml dH2O
	3.0g BSA 
	1.2ml 10%SDS
2.	Add Prehybridization solution to a glass slide-staining dish and place post-processed slides array side up into solution.  Make sure there are no bubbles on the surfaces of the slides.
3.	Place the staining jar containing the Prehybridization solution and slides into a waterbath and hybridize for 1 hour at 42oC.
4.	Take the prehybridized slides out of the Prehybridization solution and place into a slide holder submerged in a slide-washing tray containing nuclease-free water.   Wash slides for 2 minutes with constant shaking up and down.
5.	Transfer slide rack to a slide washing tray containing isopropanol and wash for 2 minutes with constant shaking up and down.
6.	Take the slides in the isopropanol bath to the centrifuge to keep the slides wet until you can dry them rapidly.  Spin at 600 RPM in a 50ml conical for 3 minutes to dry. 
**Complete this step within one hour of hybridization
 
III.  Hybridization
1.	Add the following to the 5µl labeled sample.
0.5µl 10 mg/ml tRNA
1.0µl 20X SSC
2.5ul Formamide
1.0µl 1% SDS 
2.	Heat to 98 oC for 2 minutes. Spin in centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 Xg.  Let cool for 5 min.
3.	Pipette cooled 10µl hybridization solution on microarray.  Apply 22 x 22 coverslip to cover array (if bubbles appear under the cover slip, they will slowly migrate to the edges provided that the volume is accurate). 
4.	OPTIONAL:  Apply thin wall of rubber cement around the 4 corners of the coverslip to avoid movement.  This step is recommended if your waterbath is not perfectly level.
5.	Hybridize in standard hyb. chambers with ~40µl water under each slide (20ul under both ends of each slide) overnight in 50oC water bath
**Bubbles (esp. large ones) can be troublesome for your arrays since they can cause areas of non-hybridization.  To avoid bubbles, do not use the blowout feature of the pipette when adding the probe to the slide.  Also, clean your coverslips with alcohol and lint-free wipes before placing over probe.
IV. Post Hyb washes (next day)
1.	Remove cover slip while array is submerged in first wash solution (2XSSC + 0.1% SDS), transfer to submerged microscope slide staining racks and rinse for 1 min in 1X SSC+0.05% SDS with agitation/shaking. 
2.	Rinse in 0.06X SSC with shaking. Transfer to another submerged staining rack and wash 2 min in fresh 0.06X SSC with shaking.
3.	Centrifuge 3 min at 1000 rpm in a 50ml conical (array edge up) to dry.  Scan immediately.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
After washing, the arrays were scanned with a GenePix4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).  The images were processed using GenePix 5.1 and the resulting text files were exported to Microsoft Excel.

The data were filtered by removing all spots that were below the background noise or flagged as ‘bad’.  Spots were considered to be below the background noise if the sum of the median intensities of the two channels was less than twice the highest average background of the chip.  The chips were normalized by the print-tip Lowess method {Dudoit, 2000 #200}.

II.  Prehybridization
1.  Prepare Prehybridization Solution (Fresh Each Time)
**this volume is based on a glass dish with a base measurement of 11x8cm.  This dish allows for a pre-hyb of 1-4 slides.  Adjust volume accordingly based on size of dish and/or number of slides.
	106.0ml dH2O
	3.0g BSA 
	1.2ml 10%SDS
2.	Add Prehybridization solution to a glass slide-staining dish and place post-processed slides array side up into solution.  Make sure there are no bubbles on the surfaces of the slides.
3.	Place the staining jar containing the Prehybridization solution and slides into a waterbath and hybridize for 1 hour at 42oC.
4.	Take the prehybridized slides out of the Prehybridization solution and place into a slide holder submerged in a slide-washing tray containing nuclease-free water.   Wash slides for 2 minutes with constant shaking up and down.
5.	Transfer slide rack to a slide washing tray containing isopropanol and wash for 2 minutes with constant shaking up and down.
6.	Take the slides in the isopropanol bath to the centrifuge to keep the slides wet until you can dry them rapidly.  Spin at 600 RPM in a 50ml conical for 3 minutes to dry. 
**Complete this step within one hour of hybridization
 
III.  Hybridization
1.	Add the following to the 5µl labeled sample.
0.5µl 10 mg/ml tRNA
1.0µl 20X SSC
2.5ul Formamide
1.0µl 1% SDS 
2.	Heat to 98 oC for 2 minutes. Spin in centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 Xg.  Let cool for 5 min.
3.	Pipette cooled 10µl hybridization solution on microarray.  Apply 22 x 22 coverslip to cover array (if bubbles appear under the cover slip, they will slowly migrate to the edges provided that the volume is accurate). 
4.	OPTIONAL:  Apply thin wall of rubber cement around the 4 corners of the coverslip to avoid movement.  This step is recommended if your waterbath is not perfectly level.
5.	Hybridize in standard hyb. chambers with ~40µl water under each slide (20ul under both ends of each slide) overnight in 50oC water bath
**Bubbles (esp. large ones) can be troublesome for your arrays since they can cause areas of non-hybridization.  To avoid bubbles, do not use the blowout feature of the pipette when adding the probe to the slide.  Also, clean your coverslips with alcohol and lint-free wipes before placing over probe.
IV. Post Hyb washes (next day)
1.	Remove cover slip while array is submerged in first wash solution (2XSSC + 0.1% SDS), transfer to submerged microscope slide staining racks and rinse for 1 min in 1X SSC+0.05% SDS with agitation/shaking. 
2.	Rinse in 0.06X SSC with shaking. Transfer to another submerged staining rack and wash 2 min in fresh 0.06X SSC with shaking.
3.	Centrifuge 3 min at 1000 rpm in a 50ml conical (array edge up) to dry.  Scan immediately.

Bacteria were grown in monocytes as follows. Prior to infection, the human monocytic cell line MonoMac6 was cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 9 ug/ml of bovine insulin. The cells were then infected with single-cell suspensions of M. tuberculosis in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated human serum at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1. Infected monocytes were incubated at 37 ˚C in 5% CO2.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
At 6 days after infection, the supernatant was aspirated from the infected monocytes, and the monocytes were lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer (2 M guanidine isothiocyanate, 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 300 mM LiCl, 10 mM EDTA) per 106 cells. After sonication for 10 seconds with an ultrasonic cell disrupter, the suspension was centrifuged at 7000 g for 10 min to pellet the bacilli. The pellet was washed with the extraction buffer. To disrupt the bacteria and extract the RNA, samples were transferred to Lysing Matrix B tubes (BIO 101) containing RNAzol B (TEL-TEST) and were agitated using a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101). Chloroform extraction was performed to remove proteins and DNA and then the RNA was precipitated using isopropanol. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, resuspended in DEPC-water and then any remaining chromosomal DNA was removed with “DNA-free” treatment and removal reagents (Ambion). The bacterial RNA was further purified with the MICROBEnrich kit (Ambion) which removes eukaryotic RNA. RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel.

At 6 days after infection, the supernatant was aspirated from the infected monocytes, and the monocytes were lysed with 1 ml of extraction buffer (2 M guanidine isothiocyanate, 200 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 300 mM LiCl, 10 mM EDTA) per 106 cells. After sonication for 10 seconds with an ultrasonic cell disrupter, the suspension was centrifuged at 7000 g for 10 min to pellet the bacilli. The pellet was washed with the extraction buffer. To disrupt the bacteria and extract the RNA, samples were transferred to Lysing Matrix B tubes (BIO 101) containing RNAzol B (TEL-TEST) and were agitated using a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101). Chloroform extraction was performed to remove proteins and DNA and then the RNA was precipitated using isopropanol. Pellets were washed with 70% ethanol, dried, resuspended in DEPC-water and then any remaining chromosomal DNA was removed with “DNA-free” treatment and removal reagents (Ambion). The bacterial RNA was further purified with the MICROBEnrich kit (Ambion) which removes eukaryotic RNA. RNA integrity was confirmed by electrophoresis on an agarose gel.

I. Synthesis and Labeling of cDNA
1. Bring 1.5µg of RNA to a volume of 11µl (in a PCR tube) with nucleotide-free water and add 2.2µl (2mg/ml) random primers (pulse spin to collect contents).
2. Heat 2 min at 98oC, snap cool on ice.
3. (Keep on ice) and add 11.1µl of the following reaction mix:
5.0µl 5X First-Strand buffer
2.5µl 100 mM DTT
2.3µl low dTdNTP mix (5mM A,G,C and 0.2mM T stock)
1.5ul Cy3 or Cy5
Then add 1.2ul Superscript, vortex to mix and spin to collect contents
4. Incubate 10 min at 25oC followed by 90 min at 42oC in PCR machine.
**Can freeze or leave at 4oC overnight if necessary
5. Prime a microcon10 column (YM10 from Millipore) with 400µl TE and spin for 10 min at 10,000 Xg. Empty flow-through in collection tube and return primed column. Add both reactions (cy3 and cy5) to column and centrifuge at 10,000 Xg until ~25µl remaining (~20-30 min). Wash with 200µl TE and spin until almost dry (&lt;5µl).
6. Recover cDNA by inverting microcon into new collection 1.5 ml tube and centrifuge at half max speed 1 min.
7. Bring sample to 5µl with TE.

II. Prehybridization
1. Prepare Prehybridization Solution (Fresh Each Time)
**this volume is based on a glass dish with a base measurement of 11x8cm. This dish allows for a pre-hyb of 1-4 slides. Adjust volume accordingly based on size of dish and/or number of slides.
106.0ml dH2O
3.0g BSA
1.2ml 10%SDS
2. Add Prehybridization solution to a glass slide-staining dish and place post-processed slides array side up into solution. Make sure there are no bubbles on the surfaces of the slides.
3. Place the staining jar containing the Prehybridization solution and slides into a waterbath and hybridize for 1 hour at 42oC.
4. Take the prehybridized slides out of the Prehybridization solution and place into a slide holder submerged in a slide-washing tray containing nuclease-free water. Wash slides for 2 minutes with constant shaking up and down.
5. Transfer slide rack to a slide washing tray containing isopropanol and wash for 2 minutes with constant shaking up and down.
6. Take the slides in the isopropanol bath to the centrifuge to keep the slides wet until you can dry them rapidly. Spin at 600 RPM in a 50ml conical for 3 minutes to dry.
**Complete this step within one hour of hybridization
III. Hybridization
1. Add the following to the 5µl labeled sample.
0.5µl 10 mg/ml tRNA
1.0µl 20X SSC
2.5ul Formamide
1.0µl 1% SDS
2. Heat to 98 oC for 2 minutes. Spin in centrifuge for 1 min at 12,000 Xg. Let cool for 5 min.
3. Pipette cooled 10µl hybridization solution on microarray. Apply 22 x 22 coverslip to cover array (if bubbles appear under the cover slip, they will slowly migrate to the edges provided that the volume is accurate).
4. OPTIONAL: Apply thin wall of rubber cement around the 4 corners of the coverslip to avoid movement. This step is recommended if your waterbath is not perfectly level.
5. Hybridize in standard hyb. chambers with ~40µl water under each slide (20ul under both ends of each slide) overnight in 50oC water bath
**Bubbles (esp. large ones) can be troublesome for your arrays since they can cause areas of non-hybridization. To avoid bubbles, do not use the blowout feature of the pipette when adding the probe to the slide. Also, clean your coverslips with alcohol and lint-free wipes before placing over probe.
IV. Post Hyb washes (next day)
1. Remove cover slip while array is submerged in first wash solution (2XSSC + 0.1% SDS), transfer to submerged microscope slide staining racks and rinse for 1 min in 1X SSC+0.05% SDS with agitation/shaking.
2. Rinse in 0.06X SSC with shaking. Transfer to another submerged staining rack and wash 2 min in fresh 0.06X SSC with shaking.
3. Centrifuge 3 min at 1000 rpm in a 50ml conical (array edge up) to dry. Scan immediately.

The data were filtered by removing all spots that were below the background noise or flagged as ‘bad’. Spots were considered to be below the background noise if the sum of the median intensities of the two channels was less than twice the highest average background of the chip. The chips were normalized by the print-tip Lowess method {Dudoit, 2000 #200}.

    <Summary>
We previously showed that increased expression of the principal sigma factor, SigA, mediates the capacity of Mycobacterium tuberculosis 210 strains to grow more rapidly in human monocytes, compared to other strains. To identify SigA-regulated genes that favor intracellular mycobacterial growth, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression between a recombinant M. tuberculosis 210 strain bearing a sense sigA construct and a vector control during growth in MonoMac6 cells. The most strongly upregulated gene in the sense sigA transformant was Rv2416c, which has previously been shown to enhance intracellular survival of M. smegmatis, and has been designated as eis. Real-time PCR confirmed marked upregulation of eis mRNA by the intracellular sense sigA transformant, and lysates of this transformant contained high concentrations of the Eis protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation demonstrated that SigA bound the eis promoter region in live bacteria. Deletion of the eis gene reduced growth of M. tuberculosis in macrophages, and complementation of eis reversed this effect. We conclude that SigA regulates eis expression, which in turn contributes to the enhanced capacity of the M. tuberculosis 210 strain to grow in human macrophages.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The M. tuberculosis DNA microarray consisted of 4,295 70-mer oligonucleotides representing the 3,924 predicted open reading frames of the H37Rv strain (http://www.sanger.ac.uk) and 371 probes designed to detect sequences in the CDC1551 strain (http://www.tigr.org). The arrays were prepared by spotting oligonucleotides (Tuberculosis Genome set version 1.0, Operon Biotechnologies) onto poly-L-lysine coated glass microscope slides, as described (Pang et al., 2007). Total RNA from two independent experiments was prepared from M. tuberculosis harvested from infected MonoMac6 cells, as described above. cDNA synthesis, labeling, hybridization, scanning, image acquisition and normalization were performed, as described (Pang et al., 2007), and for each experiment, a dye flip was performed. Data were filtered by removing all spots that were below the background noise or flagged as ‘bad’. Spots were considered to be below the background noise if the sum of the median intensities of the two channels was less than twice the highest mean background of the chip.  The ratio of the average median intensity of Cy5 over the average median intensity of Cy3 was determined for each spot and the fold change values were calculated.  Expression changes were considered significant if there was at least a 2-fold or higher change in expression between TB294-pSigA and TB294-pCV in three of the four array experiments.
