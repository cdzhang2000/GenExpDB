      <Extract-Protocol>
Total bacterial RNA was extracted from 3 ml of culture  which  was mixed with 6 ml of bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and  the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min in swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge to collect the cells.   Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and the cells were broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds. From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).  DNase treated and purified mRNA was used for microarray analysis.
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Cy3 or Cy5</Label>

cDNA was generated by using random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers for reverse transcription.   The primers were annealed (70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min) to total RNA (2 μg) and were extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM dNTP/ aa-UTP (Ambion, Austin, TX) mix at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was purified using a Qiagen PCR purification kit and the purified labeled cDNA was hybridized with S. aureus genome microarrays version 2.0 provided by the Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center (PFGRC).  The full genome array consists of 2592 ORFs from S. aureus reference strain COL plus an additional 117 ORFs from strains Mu50, MW2, and N315 that are not present in the COL strain’s genome complement.  Each ORF is printed in triplicate on the array.  
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Hybridization signals were scanned using an Axon4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA ) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were saved as TIFF image.  
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Genes analyzed using these programs were further sorted and grouped based on their function using our in-house software Staphylococcus aureus Gene Sorter (SAGS). Several controls were employed to minimize the technical and biological variations and to ensure that the data obtained were of good quality. First, each ORF was present in triplicate on the array.  Second, each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two separate arrays for which the incorporated dye was reversed. 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Scans were analyzed using TIGR-Spotfinder (www.tigr.org/software/) software and the local background was subsequently subtracted.   The data set was normalized by applying the LOWESS algorithm using TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software/) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/reference signal for each spot was recorded.  Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded.  The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated.  Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html  software using one class mode.

Purified labelled cDNA was hybridised with S. aureus genome microarray version 1.0   as previously described by Mongodin et al. (2003) and Riordon et al. (2007).  Briefly, the slides were prehybridized in a buffer containing 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA, and then washed and blown to dry.  The two differentially labelled cDNA samples were dried and the resuspended in hybridization solution [40% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 µg/µl sheared Salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)]. The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h.  After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC)  for 10 min.

Total bacterial RNA was extracted from 3 ml of culture  which  was mixed with 6 ml of bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and  the mixture was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 20 min in swinging-bucket rotor centrifuge to collect the cells.   Pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and the cells were broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds. From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

Purified labelled cDNA was hybridised with S. aureus genome microarray version 1.0   as previously described by Mongodin et al. (2003) and Riordon et al. (2007).  Briefly, the slides were prehybridized in a buffer containing 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA, and then washed and blown to dry.  The two differentially labelled cDNA samples were dried and the resuspended in hybridization solution [40% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 µg/µl sheared Salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)]. The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h.  After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC)  for 10 min.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Hybridization signals were scanned using an Axon4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA ) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were saved as TIFF image.  
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Genes analyzed using these programs were further sorted and grouped based on their function using our in-house software Staphylococcus aureus Gene Sorter (SAGS). Several controls were employed to minimize the technical and biological variations and to ensure that the data obtained were of good quality. First, each ORF was present in triplicate on the array.  Second, each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two separate arrays for which the incorporated dye was reversed. 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Scans were analyzed using TIGR-Spotfinder (www.tigr.org/software/) software and the local background was subsequently subtracted.   The data set was normalized by applying the LOWESS algorithm using TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software/) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/reference signal for each spot was recorded.  Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded.  The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated.  Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html  software using one class mode.

From the broken cell lysate RNA was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).  DNase treated and purified mRNA was used for microarray analysis.

cDNA was generated by using random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers for reverse transcription.   The primers were annealed (70°C for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min) to total RNA (2 μg) and were extended with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM dNTP/ aa-UTP (Ambion, Austin, TX) mix at 42°C overnight. Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment followed by neutralization, and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Purified labelled cDNA was hybridised with S. aureus genome microarray version 1.0   as previously described by Mongodin et al. (2003) and Riordon et al. (2007).  Briefly, the slides were prehybridized in a buffer containing 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS and 0.1% BSA, and then washed and blown to dry.  The two differentially labelled cDNA samples were dried and the resuspended in hybridization solution [40% deionized formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6 µg/µl sheared Salmon sperm DNA (Ambion)]. The labelled cDNA samples were hybridized with the slides at 42 °C for 18-20 h.  After hybridization, the slides were washed in low stringency buffer (2X SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 2 min, then in medium stringency (0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS) buffer for 5 min and finally high stringency buffer (0.1x SSC)  for 10 min.

    <Description>
Genes analyzed using these programs were further sorted and grouped based on their function using our in-house software Staphylococcus aureus Gene Sorter (SAGS). Several controls were employed to minimize the technical and biological variations and to ensure that the data obtained were of good quality. First, each ORF was present in triplicate on the array.  Second, each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two separate arrays for which the incorporated dye was reversed. 
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Scans were analyzed using TIGR-Spotfinder (www.tigr.org/software/) software and the local background was subsequently subtracted.   The data set was normalized by applying the LOWESS algorithm using TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software/) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/reference signal for each spot was recorded.  Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded.  The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated.  Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html  software using one class mode.

    <Summary>
Daptomycin is a  lipopeptide antibiotic that has recently been approved for treatment of Gram-positive bacterial infections.  The mode of action of daptomycin is not yet entirely clear.  To further understand the mechanism transcriptomic analysis of changes in gene expression in daptomycin-treated Staphylococcus aureus was carried out.  The expression profile indicated that cell wall stress stimulon member genes (B. J. Wilkinson, A. Muthaiyan, and R. K. Jayaswal.  2005.  Curr. Med. Chem. Anti-Infective Agents 4: 259-276) were significantly induced by daptomycin, and by the cell wall-active antibiotics vancomycin and oxacillin.  Comparison of  the daptomycin response of a two-component cell wall stress stimulon regulator VraSR mutant, S. aureus  KVR, to its parent N315 showed diminished expression of the cell wall stress stimulon  in the mutant.  Daptomycin has been proposed to cause membrane depolarization, and the transcriptional responses to carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) and nisin were determined.  Transcriptional profiles of the responses to these antimicrobial agents showed significantly different patterns compared to those of  the cell wall-active antibiotics, including little or no induction of the cell wall stress stimulon.  However, there were a significant number of genes induced by both CCCP and daptomycin that were not induced by oxacillin or vancomycin, such that the daptomycin transcriptome was probably reflecting a membrane depolarizing activity of this antimicrobial also.  The results indicate that inhibition of peptidoglycan biosynthesis, either directly or indirectly, and membrane depolarization are parts of the mode of action of daptomycin.

    <Overall-Design>
S. aureus strain ATCC 29213 was provided by Cubist Pharmaceuticals and S. aureus vraSR- mutant KVR derived from S. aureus N315 was provided by K. Hiramatsu. Strain SH1000 was also used in some experiments. Daptomycin (Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Lexington, MA), CCCP and oxacillin (Sigma Chemicals, St. Louis, MO), vancomycin (Lilly Laboratories), nisin (Danisco Beaminster Ltd, UK.) were used for transcriptional profiling.  Overnight grown S. aureus ATCC 29213 was inoculated in MHBc medium (20 ml) in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask and incubated at 37°C, with shaking at 200 rpm. Growth was measured at regular intervals at 600 nm until OD= ~0.4.  Based on the GIC study the following concentrations of antimicrobial agents were added separately for 15 min of challenge: daptomycin,  4 µg ml-1; vancomycin , 10 µg ml-1 ; CCCP, 2 µg ml-1 ; nisin, 20 µg ml-1 .  These concentrations were chosen because they gave a similar degree of inhibition of growth. For comparison purposes strain SH1000 was challenged with 1.2 µg oxacillin ml-1  for 15 min.  Hybridization signals were scanned using an Axon4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA ) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were saved as TIFF image.  Scans were analyzed using TIGR-Spotfinder (www.tigr.org/software/) software and the local background was subsequently subtracted.   The data set was normalized by applying the LOWESS algorithm using TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software/) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/reference signal for each spot was recorded.  Genes with less than three data points were considered unreliable, and their data points were discarded.  The averaged log2 ratio for each remaining gene on the four replicate slides was ultimately calculated.  Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (significance analysis of microarrays; www.tat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/index.html. Genes analyzed using these programs were further sorted and grouped based on their function using our in-house software Staphylococcus aureus Gene Sorter (SAGS). Several controls were employed to minimize the technical and biological variations and to ensure that the data obtained were of good quality. First, each ORF was present in triplicate on the array.  Second, each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two separate arrays for which the incorporated dye was reversed.
