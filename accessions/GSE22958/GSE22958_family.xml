To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo samples), we used TRIzol-preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Paratyphi A.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani (LB) broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio.

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol-preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).

Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900 [PMID 1614887]), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559 [PMID 10500215]).

Analysis used in vitro RNA as control samples for comparison to the in vivo samples.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities, and considered a cDNA for an ORF detected in a particular sample if it met the following criteria: 1) the median signal intensity of at least 2 of its 3 replicate spots on the array was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Paratyphi A genome, and 2) this criteria was met on greater than 75% of slides for that subject.  We then evaluated differences in expression in in vitro versus in vivo grown organisms for all genes detected in in vivo samples.  Using LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data, we employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with fixed type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.  We only considered array features with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity of less than 50% within an array.  We considered significant variations in signal intensity as determined by ANOVA indication of potentially differentially expressed genes.  Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetics Research, 77:123-128 (PMID 11355567) which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo samples), we used TRIzol-preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Paratyphi A.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani (LB) broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio.

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol-preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P. 1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900 [PMID 1614887]), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559 [PMID 10500215]).  We performed three rounds of SCOTS on in vivo and in vitro cDNA samples, as previously described (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559 [PMID 10500215]).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities, and considered a cDNA for an ORF detected in a particular sample if it met the following criteria: 1) the median signal intensity of at least 2 of its 3 replicate spots on the array was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Paratyphi A genome, and 2) this criteria was met on greater than 75% of slides for that subject.  We then evaluated differences in expression in in vitro versus in vivo grown organisms for all genes detected in in vivo samples.  Using LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data, we employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with fixed type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.  We only considered array features with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity of less than 50% within an array.  We considered significant variations in signal intensity as determined by ANOVA indication of potentially differentially expressed genes.  Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetics Research, 77:123-128 (PMID 11355567) which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

Using LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data, we employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with fixed type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.  We only considered array features with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity of less than 50% within an array.  We considered significant variations in signal intensity as determined by ANOVA indication of potentially differentially expressed genes.  Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetics Research, 77:123-128 (PMID 11355567) which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo samples), we used TRIzol-preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Paratyphi A.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani (LB) broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio.

    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities, and considered a cDNA for an ORF detected in a particular sample if it met the following criteria: 1) the median signal intensity of at least 2 of its 3 replicate spots on the array was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Paratyphi A genome, and 2) this criteria was met on greater than 75% of slides for that subject.  We then evaluated differences in expression in in vitro versus in vivo grown organisms for all genes detected in in vivo samples.  Using LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data, we employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with fixed type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo samples), we used TRIzol-preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Paratyphi A.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani (LB) broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio.

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol-preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P. 1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900 [PMID 1614887]), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559 [PMID 10500215]).  We performed three rounds of SCOTS on in vivo and in vitro cDNA samples, as previously described (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559 [PMID 10500215]).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities, and considered a cDNA for an ORF detected in a particular sample if it met the following criteria: 1) the median signal intensity of at least 2 of its 3 replicate spots on the array was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Paratyphi A genome, and 2) this criteria was met on greater than 75% of slides for that subject.  We then evaluated differences in expression in in vitro versus in vivo grown organisms for all genes detected in in vivo samples.  Using LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data, we employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with fixed type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.  We only considered array features with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity of less than 50% within an array.  We considered significant variations in signal intensity as determined by ANOVA indication of potentially differentially expressed genes.  Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetics Research, 77:123-128 (PMID 11355567) which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

To create cDNA of organisms in the blood of bacteremic patients (in vivo samples), we used TRIzol-preserved blood samples of patients whose day 0 culture subsequently grew S. Paratyphi A.  To generate corresponding in vitro cDNA samples, we grew each patient's bacterial isolate in Luria Bertani (LB) broth until mid-log growth phase (OD600 0.45-0.6), and then immediately placed these samples into TRIzol at a 1 (mid-log culture):2 (TRIzol) volume ratio.

We recovered total RNA from TRIzol-preserved in vivo and in vitro samples per manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and treated with DNase on RNeasy columns (Qiagen).  We converted 5 µg of total extracted RNA into cDNA using random priming (T-PCR) to obtain a representative cDNA population as described by Froussard (Froussard P. 1992. Nucleic Acids Res 20: 2900 [PMID 1614887]), with modifications as previously described by Graham (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559 [PMID 10500215]).  We performed three rounds of SCOTS on in vivo and in vitro cDNA samples, as previously described (Graham JE. 1999. PNAS. 96: 11554-11559 [PMID 10500215]).

    <Data-Processing>
For analyses, we subtracted local background from spot signal intensities, and considered a cDNA for an ORF detected in a particular sample if it met the following criteria: 1) the median signal intensity of at least 2 of its 3 replicate spots on the array was at least ten median absolute deviations greater than the median of spots on the microarray corresponding to genes absent from the S. Paratyphi A genome, and 2) this criteria was met on greater than 75% of slides for that subject.  We then evaluated differences in expression in in vitro versus in vivo grown organisms for all genes detected in in vivo samples.  Using LOESS-normalized, log-transformed data, we employed repeated measures ANOVA (to within slide replicate spots) with fixed type (in vivo versus in vitro) and dye effects with Benjamini-Hochberg correction.  We only considered array features with a coefficient of variation in signal intensity of less than 50% within an array.  We considered significant variations in signal intensity as determined by ANOVA indication of potentially differentially expressed genes.  Since the samples were hybridized to two-channel arrays, the data from different slides were not normalized to have the same median intensities. Instead we used a simple (standard) method of analysis described by Kerr et. al (2001) Genetics Research, 77:123-128 (PMID 11355567) which included a slide effect in the analysis of variance model. Thus, for each gene when comparing in vivo and in vitro levels, the slide effect was adjusted for in the model fit, and there was no need to normalize data to have same median intensities across the slides.

    <Summary>
In this work, we applied an RNA analysis method, Selective Capture of Transcribed Sequences (SCOTS), and cDNA hybridization-microarray technology to identify S. Paratyphi A transcripts expressed by bacteria in the blood of three patients in Bangladesh.  In total, we detected 1798 S. Paratyphi A mRNAs expressed in the blood of infected humans (43.9% of the ORFeome).  Of these, we identified 868 in at least two patients, and 315 in all three patients.  S. Paratyphi A transcripts identified in at least two patients encode proteins involved in energy metabolism, nutrient and iron acquisition, vitamin biosynthesis, stress responses, oxidative stress resistance, and pathogenesis.  A number of detected transcripts are expressed from PhoP and SlyA-regulated genes associated with intra-macrophage survival, genes contained within Salmonella Pathogenicity Islands (SPIs) 1-4, 6, 10, 13, and 16, as well as RpoS-regulated genes.  The largest category of identified transcripts are those encoding proteins with unknown function.  When comparing level of bacterial mRNA detection using in vivo samples collected from infected patients to samples from in vitro grown organisms, we found significant differences for 347, 391, and 456 S. Paratyphi A transcripts in each of three individual patients (approximately 9.7% of the ORFeome).  Of these, expression of 194 transcripts (4.7% of ORFs) was concordant in two or more patients, and 41 in all patients.  Genes encoding these transcripts are contained within SPI-1, 3, 6 and 10, are PhoP-regulated genes, are involved in energy metabolism, nutrient acquisition, drug resistance, or are uncharacterized genes.  Using quantitative RT-PCR, we confirmed increased gene expression in vivo for a subset of genes identified in our analyses.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We compared transcriptional profiles of S. Paratyphi A from the blood of infected humans to S. Paratyphi A grown in vitro. Replicates and dye-swaps were performed.
