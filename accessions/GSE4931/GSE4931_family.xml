An overnight starter culture of a single colony, grown in Luria Broth (LB) for 12 to 14 hours at 37 degrees C, was diluted 1:200 into 50 ml of fresh LB media and grown (37 degrees C, shaking 250 rpm in a 250 ml Erlenmeyer flask) to an optical density (600 nm wavelength) of 2.0 before 10 ml was removed and added to 20 ml Qiagen Bacterial RNA Protect reagent to kill cells and stop RNA degragation.

Total RNA (50 micrograms) was annealed with 2.4 micrograms random hexamer oligo, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42°C in the presence of 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.2 mM dTTP and 0.7 mM Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP.  RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.2 M NaOH (10 min at 70 degrees C) and the solution was quenched with 0.2 M HCl. The Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs were combined and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit, vacuum dried and suspended in 25% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml BSA (bovine serum albumin) for hybridization to the microarray.

Total RNA (50 micrograms) was annealed with 2.4 micrograms random hexamer oligo, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42°C in the presence of 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.2 mM dTTP and 0.7 mM Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP.  RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.2 M NaOH (10 min at 70 degrees C) and the solution was quenched with 0.2 M HCl.

Total RNA (50 micrograms) was annealed with 2.4 micrograms random hexamer oligo, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42°C in the presence of 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.2 mM dTTP and 0.7 mM Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP.  RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.2 M NaOH (10 min at 70 degrees C) and the solution was quenched with 0.2 M HCl. The Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs were combined and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit, vacuum dried and suspended in 25% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml BSA (bovine serum albumin) for hybridization to the microarray.

Total RNA (50  micrograms) was annealed with 2.4  micrograms random hexamer oligo, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42°C in the presence of 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.2 mM dTTP and 0.7 mM Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP.  RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.2 M NaOH (10 min at 70 degrees C) and the solution was quenched with 0.2 M HCl. The Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs were combined and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit, vacuum dried and suspended in 25% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml BSA (bovine serum albumin) for hybridization to the microarray.

Total RNA (50  micrograms) was annealed with 2.4  micrograms random hexamer oligo, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42°C in the presence of 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.2 mM dTTP and 0.7 mM Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP.  RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.2 M NaOH (10 min at 70 degrees C) and the solution was quenched with 0.2 M HCl.

Total RNA (50  micrograms) was annealed with 2.4  micrograms random hexamer oligo, and reverse-transcribed into cDNA with Superscript II reverse transcriptase for 2h at 42°C in the presence of 0.5 mM dGTP, 0.5 mM dCTP, 0.5 mM dATP, 0.2 mM dTTP and 0.7 mM Cy3 or Cy5-dUTP.  RNA was subsequently hydrolyzed by the addition of 0.2 M NaOH (10 min at 70 degrees C) and the solution was quenched with 0.2 M HCl. The Cy5 and Cy3 labelled cDNAs were combined and purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit, vacuum dried and suspended in 25% formamide, 5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml BSA (bovine serum albumin) for hybridization to the microarray.

    <Summary>
Transcriptome analysis of two independently derived hns mutants compared to an isogenic wild-type Salmonella (strain 14028s - lab ID# WN153).  Note: both the wild-type and hns strains carry an additional mutation in the rpoS locus (encoding the stationary phase sigma factor) resulting in a deletion of amino acids 61-65 that diminish its activity.
Keywords: cell type comparison
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Comparison of wild-type Salmonella typhimurium to isogenic hns mutants.  Strains were grown to OD 2.0 (600nm), before RNA was harvested.  cDNA was labeled with Cy3 or Cy5 fluorophores incoroporated during reverse transcription.  The array was hybridized with a standard Cy3/Cy5 dye-swap protocol with the exact conditions outlined in the heading for each of the samples.

The data in this series represents four biological replicates, with 6 technical replicates for each biological replicate (3 for each of 2 dye-swaps). Two of the biological replicates compare hns-mutant strain WN342 to the wild-type.  Two of the biological replicates compare hns-mutant strain WN341 to the wild-type.  This was done to account for the possibility that suppressor mutations might arise in the slower growing hns strain.  WN341 and WN342 were thought to be identical but later analysis revealed that WN341 had acquired a large deletion in the pagC/pagD region which should be accounted for when looking at the data.
