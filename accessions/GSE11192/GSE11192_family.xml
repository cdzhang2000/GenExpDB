      <Growth-Protocol>
Smooth virulent Brucella melitensis 16M Biotype 1 (ATCC 23456) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus and its derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes were filled with 10 ml of cell culture media [F12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) (ATCC)], inoculated with 0.25 ml (1:40 for late-log cultures) and 1 ml (1:10 for stationary cultures) of a saturated culture of B. melitensis 16M and incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 overnight with loose lids and 200 rpm shaking. Growth curves of cultures were determined by comparing the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU). Bacterial numbers were assessed by plating a serial dilution on tryptic soy agar (TSA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubating at 37ºC with 5% CO2 for 4 days.

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was isolated by adding ice-cold ethanol/phenol solution to the B. melitensis culture and the bacteria recovered by centrifugation. The media was then removed and the pellet suspended in TE buffer–lysozyme solution containing 10% SDS. After 2 min of incubation, acid water-saturated phenol was added to the lysate and mixed, and the sample incubated for 6 min at 64ºC. Tubes were kept on ice for at least 2 min and then centrifuged at maximum speed. The upper layer, containing the RNA, was transferred to a new tube, mixed with an equal volume of chloroform and then separated by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was mixed with 100% cold ethanol and stored at -20ºC. After at least one hour of incubation, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed in 80% ethanol and suspended in DEPC-treated water with 2% DTT and 1% RNase inhibitor. Contaminant genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment and samples were stored at -80ºC until used.  Genomic DNA was isolated from a pellet from a saturated culture of B. melitensis 16M grown on tryptic soy broth (TSB), washed with 25 ml of J-buffer [0.1M Tris pH 8.0; 0.1M EDTA; 0.15M NaCl] and then lysed in 1 ml of J-buffer containing 10% lysozyme solution (10mg/ml in 0.25M Tris, pH 8.0). After 10 min of incubation, DNA was released from the cells by sodium salt of N-lauroyl sarcosine followed by degradation of RNA by DNase-free RNase, and digestion of proteins with proteinase K. The resulting solution was transferred to a dialysis bag and dialyzed against TE [10mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 1mM EDTA] overnight at 37ºC. DNA was subsequently extracted twice using neutral water-saturated phenol first and then twice with ether before dialyzing overnight against TE. Genomic DNA was stored at 4ºC until used.

      <Label-Protocol>
Ten μg of B. melitensis 16M total RNA were reverse transcribed overnight to amino-allyl cDNA using 6 mg of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen), 0.6 μl 50X dNTPs (Invitrogen) / aa-dUTP (Ambion) mix (2:3 aa-dUTP:dTTP) and 400U Superscript III (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by incubating the samples with 1M NaOH at 65ºC for 15 min and neutralized by adding 1M HCl. Unincorparated aa-dUTPs and free amines were removed by column passage. Speedvac-dried samples were rehydrated in 0.1M Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.0) and labeled with Cy3-ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). After one hour incubation in the dark, uncoupled dye was removed using columns (Qiagen) and Cy3 incorporation calculated by NanoDrop® ND-1000 (NanoDrop). B. melitensis genomic DNA was labeled overnight by directed incorporation of Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) during reverse transcription using random primers solution and Klenow fragment from BioPrime DNA labeling system kit (Invitrogen) and 50X dNTPs (1:2 dCTP) (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of stop buffer from the BioPrime kit and unincorporated Cy dye was removed using PCR purification kit (Qiagen), eluted in 1mM Tris pH 8.0 and kept in the dark at 4ºC until used.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prior to hybridization, oligo-arrays were pretreated by washing in 0.2% SDS, followed by 3 washes in distilled water and immersed in pre-hybridization buffer [5X SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1% BSA in 100ml of water] at 45ºC for at least 45 min. Immediately before hybridization, the slides were washed 4 times in distilled water, dipped in 100% isopropanol for 10 sec and dried by centrifugation at 1,000X g for 2 min.  Dried, labeled cDNA samples were re-suspended in nuclease–free water and mixed with 0.5 μg of labeled gDNA to the final volume of 35 µl. Samples were heated at 95ºC for 5 min and then kept at 45ºC until hybridization. Following incubation at 45ºC, 35 μl of 2X formamide-based hybridization buffer [50% formamide; 10X SSC; 0.2% SDS] was added to each sample, well mixed and applied to a custom 3.2K B. melitensis oligo-arrays. Four slides for each condition (i.e. late-log and stationary growth phase) were hybridized at 45ºC for ~20 h in a dark, humid chamber (Corning) and then washed for 10 min at 45ºC with low stringency buffer [1X SSC, 0.2% SDS] followed by two 5-min washes in a higher stringency buffer [0.1X SSC, 0.2% SDS and 0.1X SSC] at room temperature with agitation. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 800X g for 2 min and immediately scanned.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Immediately after washing, the slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner (GenePix 4100; Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). The genes represented on the arrays were adjusted for background and normalized to internal controls using image analysis software (GenePixPro 4.0; Axon Instruments Inc.).

Biological replicate 1 of 4. Total RNA from BME at late log phase co-hybridized against BME gDNA.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Genes with fluorescent signal values below background were disregarded in all analyses. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA). Computational hierarchical cluster analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2. ANOVA was also performed, as an additional filtering aid, using GeneSpring. For each software program used, data were first normalized by either mean (for Spotfire pairwise comparisons and SAM two-class comparisons) or percentile value (for GeneSpring analyses). Normalizations against genomic DNA were performed as described by Talaat et al. (2002).

After 2 min of incubation, acid water-saturated phenol was added to the lysate and mixed, and the sample incubated for 6 min at 64ºC. Tubes were kept on ice for at least 2 min and then centrifuged at maximum speed. The upper layer, containing the RNA, was transferred to a new tube, mixed with an equal volume of chloroform and then separated by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was mixed with 100% cold ethanol and stored at -20ºC. After at least one hour of incubation, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed in 80% ethanol and suspended in DEPC-treated water with 2% DTT and 1% RNase inhibitor. Contaminant genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment and samples were stored at -80ºC until used.  Genomic DNA was isolated from a pellet from a saturated culture of B. melitensis 16M grown on tryptic soy broth (TSB), washed with 25 ml of J-buffer [0.1M Tris pH 8.0; 0.1M EDTA; 0.15M NaCl] and then lysed in 1 ml of J-buffer containing 10% lysozyme solution (10mg/ml in 0.25M Tris, pH 8.0). After 10 min of incubation, DNA was released from the cells by sodium salt of N-lauroyl sarcosine followed by degradation of RNA by DNase-free RNase, and digestion of proteins with proteinase K. The resulting solution was transferred to a dialysis bag and dialyzed against TE [10mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 1mM EDTA] overnight at 37ºC. DNA was subsequently extracted twice using neutral water-saturated phenol first and then twice with ether before dialyzing overnight against TE. Genomic DNA was stored at 4ºC until used.

Ten μg of B. melitensis 16M total RNA were reverse transcribed overnight to amino-allyl cDNA using 6 mg of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen), 0.6 μl 50X dNTPs (Invitrogen) / aa-dUTP (Ambion) mix (2:3 aa-dUTP:dTTP) and 400U Superscript III (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by incubating the samples with 1M NaOH at 65ºC for 15 min and neutralized by adding 1M HCl. Unincorparated aa-dUTPs and free amines were removed by column passage. Speedvac-dried samples were rehydrated in 0.1M Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.0) and labeled with Cy3-ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). After one hour incubation in the dark, uncoupled dye was removed using columns (Qiagen) and Cy3 incorporation calculated by NanoDrop® ND-1000 (NanoDrop). B. melitensis genomic DNA was labeled overnight by directed incorporation of Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) during reverse transcription using random primers solution and Klenow fragment from BioPrime DNA labeling system kit (Invitrogen) and 50X dNTPs (1:2 dCTP) (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of stop buffer from the BioPrime kit and unincorporated Cy dye was removed using PCR purification kit (Qiagen), eluted in 1mM Tris pH 8.0 and kept in the dark at 4ºC until used.

Prior to hybridization, oligo-arrays were pretreated by washing in 0.2% SDS, followed by 3 washes in distilled water and immersed in pre-hybridization buffer [5X SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1% BSA in 100ml of water] at 45ºC for at least 45 min. Immediately before hybridization, the slides were washed 4 times in distilled water, dipped in 100% isopropanol for 10 sec and dried by centrifugation at 1,000X g for 2 min.  Dried, labeled cDNA samples were re-suspended in nuclease–free water and mixed with 0.5 μg of labeled gDNA to the final volume of 35 µl. Samples were heated at 95ºC for 5 min and then kept at 45ºC until hybridization. Following incubation at 45ºC, 35 μl of 2X formamide-based hybridization buffer [50% formamide; 10X SSC; 0.2% SDS] was added to each sample, well mixed and applied to a custom 3.2K B. melitensis oligo-arrays. Four slides for each condition (i.e. late-log and stationary growth phase) were hybridized at 45ºC for ~20 h in a dark, humid chamber (Corning) and then washed for 10 min at 45ºC with low stringency buffer [1X SSC, 0.2% SDS] followed by two 5-min washes in a higher stringency buffer [0.1X SSC, 0.2% SDS and 0.1X SSC] at room temperature with agitation. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 800X g for 2 min and immediately scanned.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Immediately after washing, the slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner (GenePix 4100; Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). The genes represented on the arrays were adjusted for background and normalized to internal controls using image analysis software (GenePixPro 4.0; Axon Instruments Inc.).

    <Data-Processing>
Genes with fluorescent signal values below background were disregarded in all analyses. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA). Computational hierarchical cluster analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2. ANOVA was also performed, as an additional filtering aid, using GeneSpring. For each software program used, data were first normalized by either mean (for Spotfire pairwise comparisons and SAM two-class comparisons) or percentile value (for GeneSpring analyses). Normalizations against genomic DNA were performed as described by Talaat et al. (2002).

Smooth virulent Brucella melitensis 16M Biotype 1 (ATCC 23456) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus and its derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes were filled with 10 ml of cell culture media [F12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) (ATCC)], inoculated with 0.25 ml (1:40 for late-log cultures) and 1 ml (1:10 for stationary cultures) of a saturated culture of B. melitensis 16M and incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 overnight with loose lids and 200 rpm shaking. Growth curves of cultures were determined by comparing the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU). Bacterial numbers were assessed by plating a serial dilution on tryptic soy agar (TSA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubating at 37ºC with 5% CO2 for 4 days.

After 10 min of incubation, DNA was released from the cells by sodium salt of N-lauroyl sarcosine followed by degradation of RNA by DNase-free RNase, and digestion of proteins with proteinase K. The resulting solution was transferred to a dialysis bag and dialyzed against TE [10mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 1mM EDTA] overnight at 37ºC. DNA was subsequently extracted twice using neutral water-saturated phenol first and then twice with ether before dialyzing overnight against TE. Genomic DNA was stored at 4ºC until used.

Ten μg of B. melitensis 16M total RNA were reverse transcribed overnight to amino-allyl cDNA using 6 mg of random hexamer primers (Invitrogen), 0.6 μl 50X dNTPs (Invitrogen) / aa-dUTP (Ambion) mix (2:3 aa-dUTP:dTTP) and 400U Superscript III (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by incubating the samples with 1M NaOH at 65ºC for 15 min and neutralized by adding 1M HCl. Unincorparated aa-dUTPs and free amines were removed by column passage. Speedvac-dried samples were rehydrated in 0.1M Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.0) and labeled with Cy3-ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). After one hour incubation in the dark, uncoupled dye was removed using columns (Qiagen) and Cy3 incorporation calculated by NanoDrop® ND-1000 (NanoDrop). B. melitensis genomic DNA was labeled overnight by directed incorporation of Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) during reverse transcription using random primers solution and Klenow fragment from BioPrime DNA labeling system kit (Invitrogen) and 50X dNTPs (1:2 dCTP) (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of stop buffer from the BioPrime kit and unincorporated Cy dye was removed using PCR purification kit (Qiagen), eluted in 1mM Tris pH 8.0 and kept in the dark at 4ºC until used.

Prior to hybridization, oligo-arrays were pretreated by washing in 0.2% SDS, followed by 3 washes in distilled water and immersed in pre-hybridization buffer [5X SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1% BSA in 100ml of water] at 45ºC for at least 45 min. Immediately before hybridization, the slides were washed 4 times in distilled water, dipped in 100% isopropanol for 10 sec and dried by centrifugation at 1,000X g for 2 min.  Dried, labeled cDNA samples were re-suspended in nuclease–free water and mixed with 0.5 μg of labeled gDNA to the final volume of 35 µl. Samples were heated at 95ºC for 5 min and then kept at 45ºC until hybridization. Following incubation at 45ºC, 35 μl of 2X formamide-based hybridization buffer [50% formamide; 10X SSC; 0.2% SDS] was added to each sample, well mixed and applied to a custom 3.2K B. melitensis oligo-arrays. Four slides for each condition (i.e. late-log and stationary growth phase) were hybridized at 45ºC for ~20 h in a dark, humid chamber (Corning) and then washed for 10 min at 45ºC with low stringency buffer [1X SSC, 0.2% SDS] followed by two 5-min washes in a higher stringency buffer [0.1X SSC, 0.2% SDS and 0.1X SSC] at room temperature with agitation. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 800X g for 2 min and immediately scanned.

Immediately after washing, the slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner (GenePix 4100; Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). The genes represented on the arrays were adjusted for background and normalized to internal controls using image analysis software (GenePixPro 4.0; Axon Instruments Inc.).

    <Data-Processing>
Genes with fluorescent signal values below background were disregarded in all analyses. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA). Computational hierarchical cluster analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2. ANOVA was also performed, as an additional filtering aid, using GeneSpring. For each software program used, data were first normalized by either mean (for Spotfire pairwise comparisons and SAM two-class comparisons) or percentile value (for GeneSpring analyses). Normalizations against genomic DNA were performed as described by Talaat et al. (2002).

Smooth virulent Brucella melitensis 16M Biotype 1 (ATCC 23456) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus and its derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes were filled with 10 ml of cell culture media [F12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) (ATCC)], inoculated with 0.25 ml (1:40 for late-log cultures) and 1 ml (1:10 for stationary cultures) of a saturated culture of B. melitensis 16M and incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 overnight with loose lids and 200 rpm shaking. Growth curves of cultures were determined by comparing the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU). Bacterial numbers were assessed by plating a serial dilution on tryptic soy agar (TSA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubating at 37ºC with 5% CO2 for 4 days.

Total RNA was isolated by adding ice-cold ethanol/phenol solution to the B. melitensis culture and the bacteria recovered by centrifugation. The media was then removed and the pellet suspended in TE buffer–lysozyme solution containing 10% SDS. After 2 min of incubation, acid water-saturated phenol was added to the lysate and mixed, and the sample incubated for 6 min at 64ºC. Tubes were kept on ice for at least 2 min and then centrifuged at maximum speed. The upper layer, containing the RNA, was transferred to a new tube, mixed with an equal volume of chloroform and then separated by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was mixed with 100% cold ethanol and stored at -20ºC. After at least one hour of incubation, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed in 80% ethanol and suspended in DEPC-treated water with 2% DTT and 1% RNase inhibitor. Contaminant genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment and samples were stored at -80ºC until used.

The reaction was stopped by incubating the samples with 1M NaOH at 65ºC for 15 min and neutralized by adding 1M HCl. Unincorparated aa-dUTPs and free amines were removed by column passage. Speedvac-dried samples were rehydrated in 0.1M Na2CO3 buffer (pH 9.0) and labeled with Cy3-ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences). After one hour incubation in the dark, uncoupled dye was removed using columns (Qiagen) and Cy3 incorporation calculated by NanoDrop® ND-1000 (NanoDrop). B. melitensis genomic DNA was labeled overnight by directed incorporation of Cy5-dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ) during reverse transcription using random primers solution and Klenow fragment from BioPrime DNA labeling system kit (Invitrogen) and 50X dNTPs (1:2 dCTP) (Invitrogen). The reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of stop buffer from the BioPrime kit and unincorporated Cy dye was removed using PCR purification kit (Qiagen), eluted in 1mM Tris pH 8.0 and kept in the dark at 4ºC until used.

Prior to hybridization, oligo-arrays were pretreated by washing in 0.2% SDS, followed by 3 washes in distilled water and immersed in pre-hybridization buffer [5X SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1% BSA in 100ml of water] at 45ºC for at least 45 min. Immediately before hybridization, the slides were washed 4 times in distilled water, dipped in 100% isopropanol for 10 sec and dried by centrifugation at 1,000X g for 2 min.  Dried, labeled cDNA samples were re-suspended in nuclease–free water and mixed with 0.5 μg of labeled gDNA to the final volume of 35 µl. Samples were heated at 95ºC for 5 min and then kept at 45ºC until hybridization. Following incubation at 45ºC, 35 μl of 2X formamide-based hybridization buffer [50% formamide; 10X SSC; 0.2% SDS] was added to each sample, well mixed and applied to a custom 3.2K B. melitensis oligo-arrays. Four slides for each condition (i.e. late-log and stationary growth phase) were hybridized at 45ºC for ~20 h in a dark, humid chamber (Corning) and then washed for 10 min at 45ºC with low stringency buffer [1X SSC, 0.2% SDS] followed by two 5-min washes in a higher stringency buffer [0.1X SSC, 0.2% SDS and 0.1X SSC] at room temperature with agitation. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 800X g for 2 min and immediately scanned.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Immediately after washing, the slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner (GenePix 4100; Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). The genes represented on the arrays were adjusted for background and normalized to internal controls using image analysis software (GenePixPro 4.0; Axon Instruments Inc.).

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Genes with fluorescent signal values below background were disregarded in all analyses. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA). Computational hierarchical cluster analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2. ANOVA was also performed, as an additional filtering aid, using GeneSpring. For each software program used, data were first normalized by either mean (for Spotfire pairwise comparisons and SAM two-class comparisons) or percentile value (for GeneSpring analyses). Normalizations against genomic DNA were performed as described by Talaat et al. (2002).

Smooth virulent Brucella melitensis 16M Biotype 1 (ATCC 23456) (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA), re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus and its derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes were filled with 10 ml of cell culture media [F12K medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (HI-FBS) (ATCC)], inoculated with 0.25 ml (1:40 for late-log cultures) and 1 ml (1:10 for stationary cultures) of a saturated culture of B. melitensis 16M and incubated at 37ºC with 5% CO2 overnight with loose lids and 200 rpm shaking. Growth curves of cultures were determined by comparing the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU). Bacterial numbers were assessed by plating a serial dilution on tryptic soy agar (TSA) (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and incubating at 37ºC with 5% CO2 for 4 days.

Total RNA was isolated by adding ice-cold ethanol/phenol solution to the B. melitensis culture and the bacteria recovered by centrifugation. The media was then removed and the pellet suspended in TE buffer–lysozyme solution containing 10% SDS. After 2 min of incubation, acid water-saturated phenol was added to the lysate and mixed, and the sample incubated for 6 min at 64ºC. Tubes were kept on ice for at least 2 min and then centrifuged at maximum speed. The upper layer, containing the RNA, was transferred to a new tube, mixed with an equal volume of chloroform and then separated by centrifugation. The aqueous phase was mixed with 100% cold ethanol and stored at -20ºC. After at least one hour of incubation, RNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed in 80% ethanol and suspended in DEPC-treated water with 2% DTT and 1% RNase inhibitor. Contaminant genomic DNA was removed by RNase-free DNase I treatment and samples were stored at -80ºC until used.  Genomic DNA was isolated from a pellet from a saturated culture of B. melitensis 16M grown on tryptic soy broth (TSB), washed with 25 ml of J-buffer [0.1M Tris pH 8.0; 0.1M EDTA; 0.15M NaCl] and then lysed in 1 ml of J-buffer containing 10% lysozyme solution (10mg/ml in 0.25M Tris, pH 8.0). After 10 min of incubation, DNA was released from the cells by sodium salt of N-lauroyl sarcosine followed by degradation of RNA by DNase-free RNase, and digestion of proteins with proteinase K. The resulting solution was transferred to a dialysis bag and dialyzed against TE [10mM Tris, pH 8.0 and 1mM EDTA] overnight at 37ºC. DNA was subsequently extracted twice using neutral water-saturated phenol first and then twice with ether before dialyzing overnight against TE. Genomic DNA was stored at 4ºC until used.

Prior to hybridization, oligo-arrays were pretreated by washing in 0.2% SDS, followed by 3 washes in distilled water and immersed in pre-hybridization buffer [5X SSC, 0.1% SDS; 1% BSA in 100ml of water] at 45ºC for at least 45 min. Immediately before hybridization, the slides were washed 4 times in distilled water, dipped in 100% isopropanol for 10 sec and dried by centrifugation at 1,000X g for 2 min.  Dried, labeled cDNA samples were re-suspended in nuclease–free water and mixed with 0.5 μg of labeled gDNA to the final volume of 35 µl. Samples were heated at 95ºC for 5 min and then kept at 45ºC until hybridization. Following incubation at 45ºC, 35 μl of 2X formamide-based hybridization buffer [50% formamide; 10X SSC; 0.2% SDS] was added to each sample, well mixed and applied to a custom 3.2K B. melitensis oligo-arrays. Four slides for each condition (i.e. late-log and stationary growth phase) were hybridized at 45ºC for ~20 h in a dark, humid chamber (Corning) and then washed for 10 min at 45ºC with low stringency buffer [1X SSC, 0.2% SDS] followed by two 5-min washes in a higher stringency buffer [0.1X SSC, 0.2% SDS and 0.1X SSC] at room temperature with agitation. Slides were dried by centrifugation at 800X g for 2 min and immediately scanned.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Immediately after washing, the slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner (GenePix 4100; Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA). The genes represented on the arrays were adjusted for background and normalized to internal controls using image analysis software (GenePixPro 4.0; Axon Instruments Inc.).

Biological replicate 4 of 4. Total RNA from BME at stationary phase co-hybridized against BME gDNA.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Genes with fluorescent signal values below background were disregarded in all analyses. Data were analyzed using GeneSpring 7.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA), Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) (Stanford University, Stanford, CA) and Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA). Computational hierarchical cluster analysis and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were performed using Spotfire DecisionSite 8.2. ANOVA was also performed, as an additional filtering aid, using GeneSpring. For each software program used, data were first normalized by either mean (for Spotfire pairwise comparisons and SAM two-class comparisons) or percentile value (for GeneSpring analyses). Normalizations against genomic DNA were performed as described by Talaat et al. (2002).

    <Summary>
In this study we report that B. melitensis at the late logarithmic phase of growth are more invasive for HeLa cells than at mid logarithmic or stationary growth phases. Microarray analysis of B. melitensis gene expression identified 414 up- and 40 down-regulated genes in late-log growth phase compared to the stationary growth phase. The vast majority of the up-regulated genes in late-log cultures were those associated with DNA replication, transcription and translation, intermediate metabolism, energy production and conversion, membrane transport and cell envelope, biogenesis and outer membrane, while the down-regulated genes were distributed among several functional categories. This first Brucella global gene expression study provides novel information on growth phase-specific gene regulation important not only for understanding Brucella physiology but also the initial molecular interactions between Brucella and its host.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
There are two kind of samples consisting of RNA isolated from Brucella melitensis grown logarithmically or at stationary phase.  There are four biological replicates of each sample.  Every Brucella melitensis open reading frame was printed in triplicate on each microarray, thereby providing three technical replicates for each biological replicates.  Each replicate was normalized against labeled Brucella melitensis genomic DNA.
