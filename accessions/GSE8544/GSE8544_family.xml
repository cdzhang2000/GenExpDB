      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA from S. mutans was isolated from 50 ml cultures that were grown under the desired conditions and harvested by centrifugation at 4ºC. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 ml of DEPC-treated water, 800 ml of RNA protect reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with vortexing for 10 s at one minute intervals. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 ml Tris-EDTA (50:10) buffer and transferred to 1.5 ml screw cap tubes containing sterile glass beads (0.1 mm avg. diam.; Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), 100 ml of 1% SDS and 650 ml of acid phenol:chloroform (5:1). The mixture was homogenized in a Bead Beater twice for 40 s and chilled on ice for 2 min between cycles. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed at 4ºC. Two additional hot acid phenol:chloroform extractions were performed followed by one extraction with chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1). RNA was precipitated in the presence of isopropanol and sodium acetate, pH 5, at -20ºC for 1 h, followed by multiple washes with 70% ethanol, one wash with 99% ethanol, and drying in vacuo. RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water and digested with DNAseI (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was re-purified and treated on-column with DNaseI using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), as recommended by the supplier.

      <Label-Protocol>
All RNAs were purified as described above and used to generate cDNA according to the protocol provided by TIGR with the following minor modifications. The amount of RNA in each reaction was increased to 10 ug and the molar ratio of dTTP:aa-dUTP was increased to 1:2. SuperscriptIII Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to increase cDNA yields. Purified cDNAs were coupled with indocarbocyanine (Cy3)-dUTP

    <Data-Processing>
After the slides were scanned, single-channel images were loaded into TIGR Spotfinder software and overlayed. A spot grid was created according to TIGR specifications and manually adjusted to fit all spots within the grid, then the intensity values of each spot were measured. Data was normalized using Microarray data analysis software (MIDAS), by using LOWESS and Iterative Log Mean Centering with default settings.

RNA from S. mutans was isolated from 50 ml cultures that were grown under the desired conditions and harvested by centrifugation at 4ºC. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 ml of DEPC-treated water, 800 ml of RNA protect reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with vortexing for 10 s at one minute intervals. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 ml Tris-EDTA (50:10) buffer and transferred to 1.5 ml screw cap tubes containing sterile glass beads (0.1 mm avg. diam.; Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), 100 ml of 1% SDS and 650 ml of acid phenol:chloroform (5:1). The mixture was homogenized in a Bead Beater twice for 40 s and chilled on ice for 2 min between cycles. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed at 4ºC. Two additional hot acid phenol:chloroform extractions were performed followed by one extraction with chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1). RNA was precipitated in the presence of isopropanol and sodium acetate, pH 5, at -20ºC for 1 h, followed by multiple washes with 70% ethanol, one wash with 99% ethanol, and drying in vacuo. RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water and digested with DNAseI (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was re-purified and treated on-column with DNaseI using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), as recommended by the supplier.

All RNAs were purified as described above and used to generate cDNA according to the protocol provided by TIGR with the following minor modifications. The amount of RNA in each reaction was increased to 10 ug and the molar ratio of dTTP:aa-dUTP was increased to 1:2. SuperscriptIII Reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was used to increase cDNA yields. Reference cDNA was coupled with indodicarbocyanine (Cy5)-dUTP (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).

RNA from S. mutans was isolated from 50 ml cultures that were grown under the desired conditions and harvested by centrifugation at 4ºC. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 400 ml of DEPC-treated water, 800 ml of RNA protect reagent (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA) was added, and the samples were incubated at room temperature for 5 min with vortexing for 10 s at one minute intervals. Cells were then pelleted, resuspended in 500 ml Tris-EDTA (50:10) buffer and transferred to 1.5 ml screw cap tubes containing sterile glass beads (0.1 mm avg. diam.; Biospec, Bartlesville, OK), 100 ml of 1% SDS and 650 ml of acid phenol:chloroform (5:1). The mixture was homogenized in a Bead Beater twice for 40 s and chilled on ice for 2 min between cycles. Samples were centrifuged for 30 min at maximum speed at 4ºC. Two additional hot acid phenol:chloroform extractions were performed followed by one extraction with chloroform:isoamyl-alcohol (24:1). RNA was precipitated in the presence of isopropanol and sodium acetate, pH 5, at -20ºC for 1 h, followed by multiple washes with 70% ethanol, one wash with 99% ethanol, and drying in vacuo. RNA was resuspended in DEPC-treated water and digested with DNAseI (Ambion, Austin, TX). The RNA was re-purified and treated on-column with DNaseI using the RNeasy mini kit (QIAGEN, Inc., Chatsworth, CA), as recommended by the supplier.

    <Summary>
To gain further insights into the molecular basis of the effects of oxygen on biofilm formation by S. mutans (Ahn and Burne, 2007), we used DNA microarrays to analyze gene expression profiles of cells cultured under aerobic or anaerobic conditions.
Keywords: Oxygen, Biofilm, Caries, Microarray
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
For aerobic growth, an overnight culture of S. mutans UA159 was diluted 1:50 into a 250-ml conical flask containing 50 ml of brain heart infusion (BHI, Difco) and cultures were grown on a rotary shaker (150 rpm) at 37°C until the absorbance at 600 nm reached 0.4 (mid-exponential phase).  For anaerobic growth, cultures were similarly diluted and incubated  without agitation in a BBL GasPak Plus anaerobic system (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) to the same optical density. 

Total RNA was isolated from 10 ml of exponential phase (O.D.600 = 0.4) cultures, as described previously.  All RNA samples were DNase I-treated and purified using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).  RNA concentration was estimated spectrophotometrically in triplicate.  Reverse transcription (RT) and microarray reactions were performed with 5.0 μg of total bacterial RNA, as described elsewhere.  S. mutans UA159 microarrays were provided by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR), and each slide contained four copies of 1960 corresponding to ORFs in the genome.  For each microarray slide, a separate RNA preparation from a separate culture was utilized, so a total of 8 slides (4 for each condition) were used in this study.  Hybridizations were performed in a Maui hybridization chamber (BioMicro Systems, Salt Lake City, UT).  Additional details regarding array protocols are available at http://pfgrc.tigr.org/protocols/protocols.shtml.  

After the slides were scanned, the resulting images were analyzed by TIGR 23 
Spotfinder software (http://www.tigr.org/software/) and further normalized using LOWESS and iterative log mean centering with default settings, followed by in-slide replicate analysis using TIGR microarray data analysis system (MIDAS; http://www.tigr.org/software/).  Statistical analysis was carried out using BRB array tools (http://linus.nci.nih.gov/BRB-ArrayTools.html/) with a cutoff P value of 0.001.
