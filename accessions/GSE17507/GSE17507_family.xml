      <Treatment-Protocol>
One set of fermentations were exposed to 5 mM IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time. One set of fermentations were exposed to IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time. One set of fermentations were exposed to IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  Samples were taken 0, 1, and 4 hours post-synchronization (Time S0, S1, and S4).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cultures were heat-shocked for 15 mins at 50°C at the beginning of the late log phase (~10 OD, 5.0 g dry cell weight).  One set of fermentations were exposed to 5 mM IPTG and one set was not exposed to IPTG.  IPTG was added 8 mins into the heat-shock.  Samples were taken 15 mins after the beginning of the heat-shock.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
The strain MG1655 [pPROEx-CAT] was cultured in a fed-batch fermenter in LB media w/ glucose and a glucose/MgS04 feed at 37 degrees.  Cultures were synchronized to the late log phase, approximately 4.5 hours of fermentation time.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Fifteen mL fermentation broth was used for each RNA extraction. Harvested cells were rapidly cooled in a -80°C ethanol bath, then centrifuged at 5000 g for seven minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was frozen at -80°C. Thawed (on ice) cell pellets were suspended in 150 mL of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM EDTA) containing 0.75 mg/mL lysozyme, and incubated for 15 minutes at room temperature. Total RNA was isolated using RNAqueousTM-Midi Kit (Ambion). The concentration of purified total RNA was determined spectrophotometrically by measuring absorbance at 260 nm. The quality and integrity of the isolated RNA was confirmed by agarose gels (clear 23S and 16S rRNA bands).

The cDNA synthesis was conducted as described in Affymetrix Expression Handbook (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA). Briefly, 10 μg of purified total RNA was mixed with 750 ng of random primers (Invitrogen Life Technologies) and incubated at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The samples were cooled to 25°C and incubated for 10 minutes.  RNA/Primer hybridization mixture was mixed with dNTPs (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), Superscript II reverse transcriptase and 5X 1st Strand Buffer (Invitrogen Life Technologies), SUPERase•ln (Ambion) and DTT.  The cDNA synthesis mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes, then incubated at 42°C for 60 minutes.  The SuperScript II was heat inactivated by incubation at 70°C for 10 minutes.  The mixture was then cooled to 4°C.  RNA was degraded by the addition of 20 μL 1N NaOH.  The samples were incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes and then neutralized by 20 μL 1N HCl.  The cDNA was purified using QIAquick Columns (QIAquick® Spin Kit, QIAGEN).  cDNA product was eluted with 60 μL of elution buffer supplied with the QIAquick Kit.  Purified cDNA product was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm.  Typical yields were 4-7 μg cDNA.  Four micrograms of purified cDNA was mixed with DNase I and 10X One-phore-All Buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).  The mixture was incubated at 37°C for 10 minutes followed by inactivation of the DNase I at 98°C for 10 minutes.  Fragmentation was confirmed by separation of the cDNA on 4-20% acrylamide gels (BioRad) stained with SYBR Gold (Molecular Probes).  The majority of the DNA fragments after fragmentation were between 50-200 bases.  The fragmented cDNA was 3′-end-labeled using the Enzo® BioArrayTM Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA).  Briefly, 5X reaction buffer, 10X CoCl2, 100X Biotin-ddUTP and 50X terminal deoxynucleotides transferase were mixed and incubated at 37°C for 60 minutes.  The reaction was stopped by the addition of 2 μL 0.5 EDTA.  The product was stored at -20°C until the hybridization step.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization of the fragmented cDNA with the Affymetrix Antisense E. coli GeneChip microarrays were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions.  Briefly, samples were hybridized with the array in a solution containing 100 mM MES buffer, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA and 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20, pH 6.6 (1X MES).  Additionally, the solution contained 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA and 3.09 μg fragmented-labeled cDNA.  The hybridization cocktail (200 μL) was added to the probe array at room temperature.  The probe array was placed in a rotary hybridization oven set at 60 rpm at 45°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, the sample solution was removed and saved.  The probe array was washed and stained automatically by the fluidization station (Affymetrix Inc.) as recommended in the technical manual (Affymetrix, Inc.).  The signals were enhanced with a Streptavidin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL BSA, 10 μ/ mL streptavidin ).  After the streptavidin solution was removed, an antibody solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 0.1 mg/mL normal goat IgG and 5 μg/mL Biotin Anti-streptavidin) was added.  Streptavidin phycoerythrin solution (1X MES stain buffer, 2 mg/mL, 10 μg/mL streptavidin-phycoerythrin) was used to fluorescently label the arrays.

    <Title>Global transcriptome response of recombinant E. coli to heat-shock and dual heat-shock recombinant protein induction</Title>

    <Summary>
Recombinant Escherichia coli cultures are used to manufacture numerous therapeutic proteins and industrial enzymes, where many of these processes use elevated temperatures to induce recombinant protein production.  The heat-shock response in wild-type E. coli has been well studied.  In this study, the transcriptome profiles of recombinant E. coli subjected to a heat-shock and to a dual heat-shock recombinant protein induction were examined.  Most classical heat-shock protein genes were identified as regulated in both conditions.  The major transcriptome differences between the recombinant and reported wild-type cultures were heavily populated by hypothetical and putative genes, which indicates recombinant cultures utilize many unique genes to respond to a heat-shock.  Comparison of the dual stressed culture data with literature recombinant protein induced culture data revealed numerous differences.  The dual stressed response encompassed three major response patterns: induced-like, in-between, and greater than either individual stress response.  Also, there were no genes that only responded to the dual stress.  The most interesting difference between the dual stressed and induced cultures was the amino acid-tRNA gene levels.  The amino acid-tRNA genes were elevated for the dual cultures compared to the induced cultures.  Since tRNAs facilitate protein synthesis via translation, this observed increase in amino acid-tRNA transcriptome levels, in concert with elevated heat-shock chaperones, might account for improved productivities often observed for thermo-inducible systems.  Most importantly, the response of the recombinant cultures to a heat-shock was more profound than wild-type cultures, and further, the response to recombinant protein induction was not a simple additive response of the individual stresses.
The objective of the present work is to gain a better understanding of the heat-shock response in recombinant cultures and how this response might impact recombinant protein production.  To accomplish this objective, the transcriptome response of recombinant cultures subjected to a heat-shock and a dual heat-shock recombinant protein induction were analyzed.  The transcriptome levels were determined using Affymetrix E. coli Antisense DNA microarrays, such that the entire genome was evaluated.  These two transcriptome responses were also compared to recombinant cultures at normal growth temperature that were not over-expressing the recombinant protein and a set of literature recombinant culture data that were chemically induced to over-express the recombinant protein.  Additionally, the heat-shock response of the recombinant cultures was compared to the literature report of the heat-shock response in wild-type cultures.  The results of the global transcriptome analysis demonstrated that recombinant cultures respond differently to a heat-shock stress than wild-type cultures, where the transcriptome response of the recombinant cultures is further modified by production of a recombinant protein.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The heat-shock and recombinant protein production phases were synchronized to the cell density of 11.5 OD, which is referred to as Sample Time 0.  For the heat-shocked cultures, the temperature was increased from 37°C to 50°C over 8 minutes beginning at Sample Time 0.  The temperature and duration used in this study are the same conditions used to evaluate the heat-shock in wild-type cultures.  The temperature was then decreased from 50°C to 37°C over 4 minutes. For the dual heat-shocked recombinant protein production cultures, 5 mM IPTG was added 8 minutes after Sample Time 0. The unstressed recombinant cultures were conducted similarly, except without the heat-shock or IPTG-addition.  Each sample condition was obtained from at least two separate fermentations (two biological replicates).  RNA from each biological replicate was purified and processed independently.  Prior to hybridization, where only two biological replicates existed, one of the processed samples was divided (two technical replicates), resulting in three separate hybridized chips.  The heat-shocked and dual stressed culture samples all consisted of three technical replicates from two biological duplicates.  For the unstressed culture samples, triplicate samples were obtained for the 11.5 OD and duplicates for the 14 OD conditions.  There were no statistical differences between the 11.5 and 14 OD unstressed samples (p ≤ 0.001).  Thus, the unstressed culture transcriptome profile consisted of six technical replicates from five biological replicates and four independent fermentations.
