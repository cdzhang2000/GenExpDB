    <Description>
NimbleGen 4X72K Custom array design name 100415_Msme_GP_exp_X4. This custom array was designed for the 6716 annotated transcripts of M. smegmatis mc2155 (NCBI accession CP000480). Each chip measures the expression level of 6,588 genes from Myobacterium smegmatis. There are five 60-mer probes per transcript and two replicates of each probe for a total of 65,880 experimental probes. The design includes random GC and other control probes.
The Platform data table reflects a condensed representation of the expression array's replicate (SEQ_ID) features.  The .ndf and .ngd files are linked below as supplementary files.

This sample is of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 delta-MSMEG_0166, a triple deletion mutant in which the gene encoding MSMEG_0166 is interupted by the insertion of a hygromycin resistance cassette. It is the first of three mutant strain biological replicates used in this experiment, each from separate cultures.

Following treatment with lysozyme and mechanical disruption of the cell wall, total RNA was extracted using TriReagent (Molecular Research Center, Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA)/chloroform and cleaned up using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) or the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland). DNA was removed off-column by DNase digestion with the TURBO DNA-free kit (Applied Biosystems/Ambion, Austin, TX, USA).

    <Description>
This sample is of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 delta-MSMEG_0166, a triple deletion mutant in which the gene encoding MSMEG_0166 is interupted by the insertion of a hygromycin resistance cassette. It is the second of three mutant strain biological replicates used in this experiment, each from separate cultures.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The raw data (.pair file) was subjected to RMA (Robust Multi-Array Analysis; Irizarry et al. Biostatistics 4(2):249), quantile normalization (Bolstad et al. Bioinformatics 19(2):185), and background correction as implemented in the NimbleScan software package, version 2.4.27 (Roche NimbleGen, Inc.).

    <Summary>
Investigation of whole genome gene expression level changes in a Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 delta-MSMEG_0166 mutant, compared to the wild-type strain. MSMEG_0166 is a transcriptional regulator in the gntR family.
Mutations in MSMEG_0166 result in hypersensitivity to the bactericidal ubiquitin peptide Ub2, as well as oxidative stress caused by either organic or inorganic agents
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
A three chip study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 and three separate cultures of a MSMEG_0166 mutant strain, Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155 delta-MSMEG_0166, in which MSMEG_0166 is interupted by the insertion of a hygromycin resistance cassette.  Each chip measures the expression level of 6,588 genes from Myobacterium smegmatis with five 60-mer probes per transcript and two replicates of each probe for a total of 65,880 experimental probes.
