Each array consists of duplicates of 2,328 oligomers (70-mers) that represent all ORFs in M1 GAS, strain SF370 (GenBank accession# NC_002737) in addition to oligomers representing ORFs from prophages in strains MGAS8232 (GenBank accession# NC_003485) and MGAS315 (GenBank accession# NC_004070). The arrays also contained positive and negative controls of streptococcal ribosomal DNA and alien DNA (Stratagene), respectively.
This is a condensed version of the full array.

In vitro: Bacteria were grown in Todd Hewitt broth supplemented with 1.5% yeast extract for either 12h or (mostly) 18h; In vivo: Overnight in vitro culture was washed in phosphate-buffer saline and injected in sterile Teflon chambers implanted under mice skin

      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted with QIAgen RNeasey kit after the bacteria were beaten with beads; RNA was treated with DNase until no contaminating genomic DNA was detected; RNA was purified and concentrated with QIAgen RNeasy Microelute.
