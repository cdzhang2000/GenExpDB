      <Growth-Protocol>
H37Rv (ATCC 27294), H37RdeltadosR::kan and M. bovis BCG-Montreal (ATCC 35735) were grown to mid-log phase in 7H9 media with 0.05% Tween 80 and ADC supplement (Becton Dickinson) and stored as 1 ml aliquots in 15% glycerol (final concentration) at -80 C. For individual experiments, bacilli were grown in roller bottles in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Becton Dickinson) with 0.05% Tween 80 and ADC supplement or on Middlebrook 7H10 plates at 37 C as described previously . When needed, kanamycin was used at 30 ug/ml (50 ug/ml for E. coli) and hygromycin at 50 ug/ml (200 ug/ml for E. coli).

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A 70-mer oligonucleotide-based microarray (tuberculosis oligonucleotide set; Qiagen) was used. Hybridization solution (10 ul; labelled cDNA, 5 ug of tRNA, 2x SSC, 25% formamide, 0.1% SDS) was hybridized at 52 C.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Microarrays were scanned using a GenePix 4000 A (Axon Instruments). The intensities of the two dyes at each spot were quantified using SCANALYZE (M. Eisen; http://rana.lbl.gov/EisenSoftware.htm).

    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 6. H37Rv (wild type) grew under 0.2% Oxygen treatment
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Microarray-determined ratios were calculated from three biological replicates with two microarrays for each biological replicate. The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

Cells were disrupted by three 30-sec pulses in a BioSpec Products bead beater. After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

Biological replicate 3 of 6. H37Rv (wild type) grew under 0.2% Oxygen treatment
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Microarray-determined ratios were calculated from three biological replicates with two microarrays for each biological replicate. The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

After 5 min at room temperature, samples were centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 45 sec, and the supernatants were extracted with 300 ul of chloroformyisoamyl alcohol (24:1) and precipitated with isopropyl alcohol. Samples were incubated 10 min to overnight at 4 C and centrifuged for 10 min at 4 C. The RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol, centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 5 min, and air-dried. After suspension of the RNA pellets in 90 ul of water, 10 ul of DNase I 10x buffer and 4 units of DNase I (Ambion, Austin, TX) were added and the samples were incubated for 30 min. Final purification of RNA was by RNeasy column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA).

Biological replicate 6 of 6. H37Rv (wild type) grew under 0.2% Oxygen treatment
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Microarray-determined ratios were calculated from three biological replicates with two microarrays for each biological replicate. The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

Biological replicate 3 of 6. H37Rv dosR mutant grew under 0.2% Oxygen treatment
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Microarray-determined ratios were calculated from three biological replicates with two microarrays for each biological replicate. The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

H37Rv (ATCC 27294), H37RdeltadosR::kan and M. bovis BCG-Montreal (ATCC 35735) were grown to mid-log phase in 7H9 media with 0.05% Tween 80 and ADC supplement (Becton Dickinson) and stored as 1 ml aliquots in 15% glycerol (final concentration) at -80 C. For individual experiments, bacilli were grown in roller bottles in Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Becton Dickinson) with 0.05% Tween 80 and ADC supplement or on Middlebrook 7H10 plates at 37 C as described previously . When needed, kanamycin was used at 30 ug/ml (50 ug/ml for E. coli) and hygromycin at 50 ug/ml (200 ug/ml for E. coli).

    <Data-Processing>
Microarray-determined ratios were calculated from three biological replicates with two microarrays for each biological replicate. The overall reproducibility of the microarray experiments was evaluated using the Signifi-cance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) program.  The SAM algorithm was set for two-class unpaired analysis with 500 permutations and K-nearest imputer for missing data. Significantly regulated genes were selected by adjusting the delta value to give a false discovery rate below 1%. In each data set, all genes regulated 1.5-fold and greater were determined to be significant with a false discovery rate of less than 1%, indicating a high degree of reproducibility.

    <Summary>
Unlike many pathogens that are overtly harmful to their hosts, Mycobacterium tuberculosis can persist for years within humans in a clinically latent state. Latency is often linked to hypoxic conditions within the host. Among M. tuberculosis genes induced by hypoxia is a putative transcription factor, Rv3133c/DosR. We performed targeted disruption of this locus followed by transcriptome analysis of wild-type and mutant bacilli. Nearly all the genes powerfully regulated by hypoxia require Rv3133c/DosR for their induction. Computer analysis identified a consensus motif, a variant of which is located upstream of nearly all M. tuberculosis genes rapidly induced by hypoxia. Further, Rv3133c/DosR binds to the two copies of this motif upstream of the hypoxic response gene alpha-crystallin. Mutations within the binding sites abolish both Rv3133c/DosR binding as well as hypoxic induction of a downstream reporter gene. Also, mutation experiments with Rv3133c/DosR confirmed sequence-based predictions that the C-terminus is responsible for DNA binding and that the aspartate at position 54 is essential for function. Together, these results demonstrate that Rv3133c/DosR is a transcription factor of the two-component response regulator class, and that it is the primary mediator of a hypoxic signal within M. tuberculosis.
