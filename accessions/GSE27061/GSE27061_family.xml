Overnight culture was grown in 100ml TSB containing erythromycin 10 ug/ml. Next day 1 ml of that overnight culture was inoculated in to 100 ml TSB without antibiotics and grown for 3 hours. After 3 hours that culture was used to inoculate another flask of 100 ml TSB without antibiotics to an OD of 0.05 at 600 nm. After 3 hours of incubation, 3 ml of this culture is mixed with 6 ml of Bacterial RNA Protect solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cells were harvested by centrifuging the mixture for 10 min at 7300 rpm in a table top centrifuge. The pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Resuspended cells were broken using the FastPrep sytem (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds and RNA from the lysate was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) was used to purify the extracted RNA. An on-column DNase (Qiagen) treatment was done. The quality and the concentration of the RNA were then analyzed using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

RNA labeling and hybridization were done as per TIGR protocol (Standard operating procedure no. M007: http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/microarray/protocols.html). Briefly, random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers were annealed to 2.5 µg of the total RNA (70oC for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min), along with RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (Invitrogen). The primers were then extended using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M DTT and 12.5 M of aa-dNTP/aa-dUTP mix (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 42oC overnight.  Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment with 1 M NaOH followed by neutralization with 1 M Tris (pH 7.4). The resulting cDNA was purified using Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 mono-Reactive dyes (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburg, PA) as per manufacturer’s instruction.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was purified using MinElute PCR purification kit and hybridized with S. aureus COL genome microarrays version 6.0, provided by Pathogen Functional Genomics Resource Center (PFGRC), as per the TIGR protocol (Standard operating procedure no. M008: http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/microarray/protocols.html). Briefly, the slides were treated with a preheated pre-hybridization buffer (5 X SSC [Ambion], 0.1 % SDS and 1 % BSA [Sigma, St. Louis, MO]) at 42oC for 1 hr. Slides were then washed with distilled water followed by washing with isopropanol and dried by centrifuging. The dried Cy3 and Cy5 labeled cDNA was resuspended using hybridization buffer (50 % formamide, 5 X SSC, 0.1 % SDS and 300 µg sheared salmon sperm DNA [Ambion]) and denatured at 95oC. The sample was then applied to the pre-hybridized slides under the LifterSlip (Fisher, Pittsburg, PA). The slides were incubated at 42oC overnight. The hybridized slides were serially washed with low, medium and high stringency wash buffers and dried by centrifuging.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanning was done using Axon 4200A scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). The microarray scans were saved as TIFF image files.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
We did four hybridizations for this experiment, including a biological replicate and a dye-swap experiment for each replicate to account for dye-bias.The data from the replicates were combined (using the median value) and a one-sample t-test was performed. The volcano plot was used with a fold change cut-off of &gt;= 2 and a p-value of &lt;0.05, to filter the genes that were differentially expressed.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
GenePix Pro 6 (Molecular Devices) was used to extract the spot intensity values and generate GPR files from the microarray image files. Further data analysis was done using the Acuity 4.0 software (Molecular Devices). Spots flagged as empty or bad were excluded and the raw data from each slide was normalized using LOWESS method, with background correction.

Overnight culture was grown in 100ml TSB containing erythromycin 10 ug/ml. Next day 1 ml of that overnight culture was inoculated in to 100 ml TSB without antibiotics and grown for 3 hours. After 3 hours that culture was used to inoculate another flask of 100 ml TSB without antibiotics to an OD of 0.05 at 600 nm. After 3 hours of incubation, 3 ml of this culture is mixed with 6 ml of Bacterial RNA Protect solution (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The cells were harvested by centrifuging the mixture for 10 min at 7300 rpm in a table top centrifuge. The pellets were then resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). Resuspended cells were broken using the FastPrep sytem (Qbiogene, Irvine, CA) at a speed of 6.0 for 40 seconds and RNA from the lysate was extracted as per the manufacturer’s instructions. RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) was used to purify the extracted RNA. An on-column DNase (Qiagen) treatment was done. The quality and the concentration of the RNA were then analyzed using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA).

RNA labeling and hybridization were done as per TIGR protocol (Standard operating procedure no. M007: http://pfgrc.jcvi.org/index.php/microarray/protocols.html). Briefly, random hexamers (Invitrogen) as primers were annealed to 2.5 µg of the total RNA (70oC for 10 min, followed by snap-freezing in ice for 1 min), along with RNaseOUT recombinant ribonuclease inhibitor (Invitrogen). The primers were then extended using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) with 0.1 M DTT and 12.5 M of aa-dNTP/aa-dUTP mix (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 42oC overnight.  Residual RNA was removed by alkaline treatment with 1 M NaOH followed by neutralization with 1 M Tris (pH 7.4). The resulting cDNA was purified using Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and labeled with Cy3 and Cy5 mono-Reactive dyes (Amersham Biosciences, Pittsburg, PA) as per manufacturer’s instruction.

    <Title>NsaRS is a Cell-Envelope-Stress Sensing Two-Component System of Staphylococcus aureus</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE27061</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>21565927</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
S. aureus possesses 16 two-component systems (TCS), two of which (GraRS &amp; NsaRS) belong to the intramembrane-sensing histidine kinase (IM-HK) family, conserved within the firmicutes. NsaRS has recently been documented as being important for nisin-resistance in S. aureus. In this study we present a detailed characterization of NsaRS and reveal that, as with other IM-HK TCS, it responds to disruptions in cell-wall stability. Analysis using a lacZ reporter-gene fusion demonstrated that nsaRS expression is upregulated by a variety of cell-wall damaging antibiotics, including Phosphomycin, Ampicillin, Nisin and Penicillin G. Additionally; we reveal that NsaRS regulates a downstream transporter, NsaAB, during nisin-induced stress. NsaS mutants also display a 200-fold decreased ability to develop resistance to the cell-wall targetting antibiotic bacitracin. Microarray analysis reveals the transcription of 245 genes is altered in a nsaS mutant, with the vast majority down-regulated. Included within this list are genes involved in transport, drug-resistance, cell-envelope synthesis, transcriptional regulation, amino acid metabolism and virulence. Using ICP-MS we observed a decrease in intracellular divalent metal ions in an nsaS mutant when grown under low affinity conditions. Characterization of cells using electron microscopy reveals that nsaS mutants have alterations in both cell-wall and cell-envelope structure. Finally, a variety of virulence related phenotypes are impaired in nsaS mutants, including biofilm formation, resistance to killing by human macrophages and survival in whole human blood. Thus NsaRS is important in sensing cell-wall instability in S. aureus, and functions to reprogram gene expression to modify cell-envelope architecture, facilitating adaptation and survival.
