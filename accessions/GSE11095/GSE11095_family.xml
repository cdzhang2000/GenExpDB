1.  Oligos are arrayed in Greiner 384-well flat-bottom plates. Each well contains 600 pmol of 70-mer oligo.
2. Resuspend oligos in water to 20 uM and rearray 5 ÂµL into 384-well, Genetix polystyrene V-bottom plates (cat# X6004).
3. Allow Genetix plates to dry through passive water evaporation in a protected environment (e.g., chemical hood).
4. Before printing, add 5 ÂµL of 1X Printing Buffer to each well. This can be done the night before a print run is started.
5. Seal plates with Corning seals.
6. Incubate at 37Â°C for 30 minutes to aid resuspension of DNA.
7. Shake plates near maximum rotational speed on flat-bed shaker for 1 minute.
8. Centrifuge plates at 2000 rpm for 3 minutes.
9. Remove seals and cover with plate lids. Place in appropriate location of plate cassette. This should be done with first plates just before print run is started to minimize evaporation time before printing. For second and third cassettes, wait until 30 minutes before next cassette is needed to begin centrifugation.
10. Make sure plates rest behind both holding clips in the cassettes. Push plates back into the cassettes as far as they will go, putting them in the proper position for the server arm.
11. After the print run is completed, allow plates to dry through passive evaporation in a protected environment.
12. For each subsequent preparation of these plates for a print run, add water to the wells instead of sodium phosphate buffer. The amount of water should be decreased by 0.25 ÂµL per print run, as this is the amount drawn up by the pin capillary during each dip.

5 ug total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamer primers in the presence of aa-dUTP. cDNA was labelled with Cy dyes (Amersham) and purified over Zymo DNA binding columns.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Cy5 and Cy3 labelled probes were mixed and hybridized to oligonucleotide MTB arrays (Operon Biosystems) at 63 C for 18h.After hybridization, slides were washed in batch.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using an Axon 4000B scanner and GenePix software.
Data was acquired using Spotreader 1.3.1.0 and Acuity 4.0 software
