The Tuberculosis Genome Oligo Set consisting of 70mer probes representing 4,269 Mtb (H37Rv and CDC1551) genes, plus 26 controls were obtained from “TB Vaccine Testing and Research Materials” Contract, Colorado State University. Experiments were performed according to standard Mycobacteria Research Laboratories (MRL) at Colorado State University protocols (http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/mip/tb/pdf/arrays.pdf).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner.
Biological duplicate hybridizations were performed using PDS samples derived from THZ treated and vehicle treated control samples of M. tuberculosis. Spots with i) imperfect spot morphology; ii) a signal to noise ratio &lt; 1.5 in more than 50% of instances; iii) saturated intensity for &gt;65% of the pixels in at least one channel; and iv) co-efficient of variance &gt;20% within the quadruplicates on one slide, were excluded from analysis.

    <Description>
Comparisons of non-treated cultures at 0h.

    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using S+ scripts within Spotfire DecisionSite for Microarray Analysis (TIBCO-Spotfire Inc.) to determine statistically significant expression changes, adjusting for intensity bias using Locally Weighted Scatter-plot Smoothing (LOWESS) normalization (Mehra et al., 2009).

The Tuberculosis Genome Oligo Set consisting of 70mer probes representing 4,269 Mtb (H37Rv and CDC1551) genes, plus 26 controls were obtained from “TB Vaccine Testing and Research Materials” Contract, Colorado State University. Experiments were performed according to standard Mycobacteria Research Laboratories (MRL) at Colorado State University protocols (http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/mip/tb/pdf/arrays.pdf).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner.
Biological duplicate hybridizations were performed using PDS samples derived from THZ treated and vehicle treated control samples of M. tuberculosis. Spots with i) imperfect spot morphology; ii) a signal to noise ratio &lt; 1.5 in more than 50% of instances; iii) saturated intensity for &gt;65% of the pixels in at least one channel; and iv) co-efficient of variance &gt;20% within the quadruplicates on one slide, were excluded from analysis.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Comparisons of THZ treated (4X MIC) (ch1) vs non-treated cultures at 1h (ch2)
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using S+ scripts within Spotfire DecisionSite for Microarray Analysis (TIBCO-Spotfire Inc.) to determine statistically significant expression changes, adjusting for intensity bias using Locally Weighted Scatter-plot Smoothing (LOWESS) normalization (Mehra et al., 2009).

Spots with i) imperfect spot morphology; ii) a signal to noise ratio &lt; 1.5 in more than 50% of instances; iii) saturated intensity for &gt;65% of the pixels in at least one channel; and iv) co-efficient of variance &gt;20% within the quadruplicates on one slide, were excluded from analysis.

Comparisons of THZ treated (4X MIC) (ch1) vs non-treated cultures at 2h (ch2)
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using S+ scripts within Spotfire DecisionSite for Microarray Analysis (TIBCO-Spotfire Inc.) to determine statistically significant expression changes, adjusting for intensity bias using Locally Weighted Scatter-plot Smoothing (LOWESS) normalization (Mehra et al., 2009).

The Tuberculosis Genome Oligo Set consisting of 70mer probes representing 4,269 Mtb (H37Rv and CDC1551) genes, plus 26 controls were obtained from “TB Vaccine Testing and Research Materials” Contract, Colorado State University. Experiments were performed according to standard Mycobacteria Research Laboratories (MRL) at Colorado State University protocols (http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/mip/tb/pdf/arrays.pdf).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanned on an Agilent G2565AA scanner.
Biological duplicate hybridizations were performed using PDS samples derived from THZ treated and vehicle treated control samples of M. tuberculosis. Spots with i) imperfect spot morphology; ii) a signal to noise ratio &lt; 1.5 in more than 50% of instances; iii) saturated intensity for &gt;65% of the pixels in at least one channel; and iv) co-efficient of variance &gt;20% within the quadruplicates on one slide, were excluded from analysis.

Comparisons of THZ treated (4X MIC) (ch1) vs non-treated cultures at 4h (ch2)
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were analyzed using S+ scripts within Spotfire DecisionSite for Microarray Analysis (TIBCO-Spotfire Inc.) to determine statistically significant expression changes, adjusting for intensity bias using Locally Weighted Scatter-plot Smoothing (LOWESS) normalization (Mehra et al., 2009).

    <Title>Mycobacterium tuberculosis gene expression in response to thioridazine (THZ)</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE16626</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>20386700</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
The gene expression profiles of Mtb after treatment at the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) or 4 X MIC at an early stage (up to 6 hours) was compared to untreated Mtb.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Our experiment is designed to in order to ensure that the primary effects (0-6h) of the drugs and any dose (1X MIC and 4X MIC)  responses would be captured.

    <Type>Expression profiling by array</Type>
