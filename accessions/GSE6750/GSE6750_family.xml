M. tuberculosis mutants and parental strain H37Rv were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, or Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco), both enriched with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; Difco). Broth cultures were incubated at 37C with gentle shaking, under normal atmospheric conditions (without additional CO2), except where indicated. Escherichia coli Novablue and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were used as host strains for general cloning and gene expression, respectively. E. coli strains were grown on L agar or in L broth. Antibiotics were added to growth media as required.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

Cultures were grown to early log phase (O.D.600 &lt; 0.2), and divided into two 25 ml samples. SDS was added to one sample for each strain to a final concentration of 0.05%. Samples were incubated at 37oC, and then aliquots were removed at 2 hr or 5 hr, centrifuged to remove SDS, and then diluted in PBS prior to plating in duplicate. Coloines were counted after 2 weeks to determine percent survival in the stress-treated samples compared to untreated controls. No additional increase in colony number was observed after further incubation.

Cultures were grown to early log phase (O.D.600 &lt; 0.2), and divided into two 25 ml samples. SDS was added to one sample for each strain to a final concentration of 0.05%. Samples were incubated at 37oC, and then aliquots were removed at 2 hr or 5 hr, centrifuged to remove SDS, and then diluted in PBS prior to plating in duplicate. Coloines were counted after 2 weeks to determine percent survival in the stress-treated samples compared to untreated controls. No additional increase in colony number was observed after further incubation.

M. tuberculosis mutants and parental strain H37Rv were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, or Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco), both enriched with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; Difco). Broth cultures were incubated at 37oC with gentle shaking, under normal atmospheric conditions (without additional CO2), except where indicated. Escherichia coli Novablue and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were used as host strains for general cloning and gene expression, respectively. E. coli strains were grown on L agar or in L broth.

Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

M. tuberculosis mutants and parental strain H37Rv were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, or Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco), both enriched with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; Difco). Broth cultures were incubated at 37oC with gentle shaking, under normal atmospheric conditions (without additional CO2), except where indicated. Escherichia coli Novablue and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were used as host strains for general cloning and gene expression, respectively. E. coli strains were grown on L agar or in L broth. Antibiotics were added to growth media as required.

Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

Samples were incubated at 37oC, and then aliquots were removed at 2 hr or 5 hr, centrifuged to remove SDS, and then diluted in PBS prior to plating in duplicate. Coloines were counted after 2 weeks to determine percent survival in the stress-treated samples compared to untreated controls. No additional increase in colony number was observed after further incubation.

M. tuberculosis mutants and parental strain H37Rv were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, or Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco), both enriched with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; Difco). Broth cultures were incubated at 37oC with gentle shaking, under normal atmospheric conditions (without additional CO2), except where indicated. Escherichia coli Novablue and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were used as host strains for general cloning and gene expression, respectively. E. coli strains were grown on L agar or in L broth. Antibiotics were added to growth media as required.

Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

M. tuberculosis mutants and parental strain H37Rv were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, or Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco), both enriched with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; Difco). Broth cultures were incubated at 37oC with gentle shaking, under normal atmospheric conditions (without additional CO2), except where indicated. Escherichia coli Novablue and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were used as host strains for general cloning and gene expression, respectively. E. coli strains were grown on L agar or in L broth. Antibiotics were added to growth media as required.

Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

Cultures were grown to early log phase (O.D.600 &lt; 0.2), and divided into two 25 ml samples. SDS was added to one sample for each strain to a final concentration of 0.05%. Samples were incubated at 37oC, and then aliquots were removed at 2 hr or 5 hr, centrifuged to remove SDS, and then diluted in PBS prior to plating in duplicate. Coloines were counted after 2 weeks to determine percent survival in the stress-treated samples compared to untreated controls. No additional increase in colony number was observed after further incubation.

Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cultures were grown to early log phase (O.D.600 &lt; 0.2), and divided into two 25 ml samples. SDS was added to one sample for each strain to a final concentration of 0.05%. Samples were incubated at 37oC, and then aliquots were removed at 2 hr or 5 hr, centrifuged to remove SDS, and then diluted in PBS prior to plating in duplicate. Coloines were counted after 2 weeks to determine percent survival in the stress-treated samples compared to untreated controls. No additional increase in colony number was observed after further incubation.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
M. tuberculosis mutants and parental strain H37Rv were grown in either Middlebrook 7H9 broth containing 0.05% Tween 80, or Middlebrook 7H10 agar (Difco), both enriched with 10% oleic acid-albumin-dextrose-catalase (OADC; Difco). Broth cultures were incubated at 37oC with gentle shaking, under normal atmospheric conditions (without additional CO2), except where indicated. Escherichia coli Novablue and Rosetta(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) were used as host strains for general cloning and gene expression, respectively. E. coli strains were grown on L agar or in L broth. Antibiotics were added to growth media as required.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Mycobacterial strains were cultured in 7H9 medium to mid-log phase (OD600nm of 0.4-0.5) at 37oC with shaking. Cultures for the DNA microarray experiments were grown in the absence of CO2. For other experiments, cultures were grown with or without 5% CO2 as indicated. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction, except that lysing matrix B and a FastPrep FP120 shaker (BIO 101) were used to disrupt the mycobacteria. With large culture volumes, bacteria were first pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in a small volume of 0.2% Tween, prior to adding to the lysing tubes. Chromosomal DNA was removed with DNA-free reagents (Ambion), according to the manufacturer's instructions. For experiments with detergent stress, cultures were grown to log phase (O.D.600 of 0.3-0.4), SDS was added to a final concentration of 0.05%, and RNA was extracted from control and SDS-treated samples after 90 min incubation at 37?.

    <Title>Complex interactions of stress-associated regulons in an mprAB deletion mutant of Mycobacterium tuberculosis</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE6750</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>17379732</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Using a deletion mutant lacking portions of the response regulator, MprA, and the histidine kinase, MprB, we demonstrated by DNA microarrays that MprAB activates sigE and sigB under SDS stress and during logarithmic growth.
Keywords: effects of 0.05% SDS on Mtb gene expression
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
The expression of SigE-regulated genes {Manganelli, 2004 #212} was evaluated in SDS-treated and control cultures of H37Rv and Rv-D981, using array analyses, for each pair of samples in each experiment, dye flips were performed
