      <Growth-Protocol>
Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

      <Extract-Protocol>
At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label>Alexa 555</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Printed slides were submerged in 0.2 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 2 minutes and washed three times in containers with ample ddH2O.  The microarray slides were placed in a prehybridization solution (5X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.1 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 1 % (w/v) BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)) pre-warmed to 45°C for a minimum of 45 minutes.  Following prehybridization, the slides were washed five times in containers containing ample ddH2O, submerged once in isopropanol, and then immediately dried by centrifugation at 207 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 table top centrifuge.  The resuspended labeled RNA was combined with 1 µg of labeled genomic DNA from B. melitensis 16M to a total volume of 35 µl.  The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner GenePix 4100A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Genepix 6.1 Pro software.  The auto-PMT (photomultiplier tube) function was used to determine the optimal gain for each laser channel with each slide.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis culture grown cells to logarithmic growth phase (OD600=0.4), labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.

The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

Following prehybridization, the slides were washed five times in containers containing ample ddH2O, submerged once in isopropanol, and then immediately dried by centrifugation at 207 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 table top centrifuge.  The resuspended labeled RNA was combined with 1 µg of labeled genomic DNA from B. melitensis 16M to a total volume of 35 µl.  The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 2 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis culture grown cells to logarithmic growth phase (OD600=0.4), labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

      <Extract-Protocol>
At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

      <Extract-Protocol>
At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label>Alexa 555</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Printed slides were submerged in 0.2 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 2 minutes and washed three times in containers with ample ddH2O.  The microarray slides were placed in a prehybridization solution (5X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.1 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 1 % (w/v) BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)) pre-warmed to 45°C for a minimum of 45 minutes.  Following prehybridization, the slides were washed five times in containers containing ample ddH2O, submerged once in isopropanol, and then immediately dried by centrifugation at 207 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 table top centrifuge.  The resuspended labeled RNA was combined with 1 µg of labeled genomic DNA from B. melitensis 16M to a total volume of 35 µl.  The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner GenePix 4100A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Genepix 6.1 Pro software.  The auto-PMT (photomultiplier tube) function was used to determine the optimal gain for each laser channel with each slide.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 2 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis culture grown cells to logarithmic growth phase (OD600=0.4) with 50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL added at inoculation, labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Printed slides were submerged in 0.2 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 2 minutes and washed three times in containers with ample ddH2O.  The microarray slides were placed in a prehybridization solution (5X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.1 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 1 % (w/v) BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)) pre-warmed to 45°C for a minimum of 45 minutes.  Following prehybridization, the slides were washed five times in containers containing ample ddH2O, submerged once in isopropanol, and then immediately dried by centrifugation at 207 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 table top centrifuge.  The resuspended labeled RNA was combined with 1 µg of labeled genomic DNA from B. melitensis 16M to a total volume of 35 µl.  The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

Biological replicate 1 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis 16M∆vjbR culture grown cells to logarithmic growth phase (OD600=0.4), labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).

The microarray slides were placed in a prehybridization solution (5X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.1 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 1 % (w/v) BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)) pre-warmed to 45°C for a minimum of 45 minutes.  Following prehybridization, the slides were washed five times in containers containing ample ddH2O, submerged once in isopropanol, and then immediately dried by centrifugation at 207 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 table top centrifuge.  The resuspended labeled RNA was combined with 1 µg of labeled genomic DNA from B. melitensis 16M to a total volume of 35 µl.  The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 3 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis 16M∆vjbR culture grown cells to logarithmic growth phase (OD600=0.4), labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

      <Extract-Protocol>
At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

      <Extract-Protocol>
At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label>Alexa 555</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Printed slides were submerged in 0.2 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 2 minutes and washed three times in containers with ample ddH2O.  The microarray slides were placed in a prehybridization solution (5X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.1 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 1 % (w/v) BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)) pre-warmed to 45°C for a minimum of 45 minutes.  Following prehybridization, the slides were washed five times in containers containing ample ddH2O, submerged once in isopropanol, and then immediately dried by centrifugation at 207 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 table top centrifuge.  The resuspended labeled RNA was combined with 1 µg of labeled genomic DNA from B. melitensis 16M to a total volume of 35 µl.  The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a commercial laser scanner GenePix 4100A (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) and Genepix 6.1 Pro software.  The auto-PMT (photomultiplier tube) function was used to determine the optimal gain for each laser channel with each slide.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 3 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis culture grown cells to stationary growth phase (OD600=1.5), labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).

The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Printed slides were submerged in 0.2 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 2 minutes and washed three times in containers with ample ddH2O.  The microarray slides were placed in a prehybridization solution (5X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.1 % SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX), and 1 % (w/v) BSA (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)) pre-warmed to 45°C for a minimum of 45 minutes.  Following prehybridization, the slides were washed five times in containers containing ample ddH2O, submerged once in isopropanol, and then immediately dried by centrifugation at 207 x g for 2 minutes at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 table top centrifuge.  The resuspended labeled RNA was combined with 1 µg of labeled genomic DNA from B. melitensis 16M to a total volume of 35 µl.  The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

Biological replicate 2 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis culture grown cells to stationary growth phase (OD600=1.5) with 50 ng ml-1 exogenous C12-HSL added at inoculation, labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.

The sample was heated at 95°C for 5 minutes and held at 45°C until hybridization to the microarray slide.  The labeled cDNA was combined with 1X hybridization buffer (25 % (v/v) formamide (Sigma, St. Louis, Mo), 1X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.1 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) and applied to the microarray with a 22 x 60 mm LifterSlip (Erie Scientific Company, Portsmouth, NH).  The microarray was incubated in a water bath for approximately 21 hours at 42°C in a sealed hybridization chamber (Corning, Corning, NY).    After hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times with agitation at room temperature.  The first wash buffer (2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) and 0.2 % (v/v) SDS (Ambion, Austin, TX)) was pre-heated to 42°C and the microarray was washed for 10 minutes, followed by a 5 minute wash in 2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX).  The microarray was subsequently washed a third time in 0.2X SSC (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 5 minutes.  Immediately after the last wash, the arrays were dried by centrifugation for 2 minutes at 207 x g at room temperature in a Jouan CR422 tabletop centrifuge.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 3.
Total RNA from Brucella melitensis 16M∆vjbR culture grown cells to stationary growth phase (OD600=1.5), labeled with Alexa 555 and hybridized to the microarray with Brucella melitensis genomic DNA labeled with Cy5.  The same genomic DNA sample was hybridized to all microarrays.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Spots that were flagged as bad or absent were removed from the analysis and background values were subtracted.  Raw Alexa 555 signals were normalized against the mean of the baseline Cy5 gDNA reference.  GeneSifter (VizX Labs, Seattle, WA) was used to perform global mean normalization on the signal values already normalized to the reference channel.  Genes were retained if their signals were altered by at least a 1.5-fold change between conditions and a p value of 0.05 or less was obtained applying a Student’s t-test.  To further filter data based on biological relevance, individual pairwise comparisons were also performed on signal values after global mean normalization using Spotfire DecisionSite 9.0 (Spotfire, Inc., Somerville, MA).  Any fold-change observed between test conditions were expected to be at least 50 % greater in magnitude (e.g., 1.5-fold greater) than the fold-change observed between any two biological replicate samples.  Genes that did not meet the criteria were removed from the analysis.  For the samples extracted during the exponential growth phase, the analysis was modified to account for variation revealed by scatter plots fitted with a trend line using the normalized signal values in the wild type samples.  In addition to the analysis described above, a separate comparison was performed that included only the two similar wild type samples.  The resulting fold-change values were expected to be greater than 50% of the value obtained for wild type 1 versus wild type 2.  A Student’s t-test was performed, retaining genes that had a p value of less than 0.05.  Genes that passed the conditions in either analysis method were considered statistically significant.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Brucella melitensis 16M Bv. 1 was obtained from ATCC and re-isolated from an aborted goat fetus by this lab.  B. melitensis 16M Bv. 1 and its genetically modified derivatives were maintained as frozen glycerol stocks.  Strains were plated for isolation on TSA and incubated at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 3 days.  Individual 50 ml conical tubes with 5 ml of Brucella Broth (Difco Laboratories, Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were inoculated from an isolated single colony and incubated at 37ºC with agitation for 48 hours.  Cultures were then inoculated 1:1000 in Brucella Broth and grown at 37°C with agitation.  50 ng/ml exogenous C12-HSL (Sigma) was added to some cultures at inoculation. Growth curves of cultures were determined by the optical density (OD) of the culture at 600nm with bacterial colony forming units (CFU).  For cells at logarithmic phase of growth, OD600=0.4; for cells at stationary phase of growth, OD600=1.5.

      <Extract-Protocol>
At harvest time, 14 % (v/v) of a cold ethanol solution containing 5 % (v/v) acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added to the bacterial culture and immediately centrifuged at 10900 x g for 3 minutes.  The supernatant was removed and the bacterial pellet was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C.  RNA was collected by re-suspending the bacterial pellets in 0.5 mg/ml lysozyme (Amresco, Solon, OH) dissolved in TE, followed by the addition of 0.97 % (v/v) SDS.  The cells were then incubated at 64°C for 2 minutes.  Next, 0.5 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) was added, mixed gently by inversion and an equal volume of acidic water saturated phenol (Ultrapure, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was added and mixed well by inversion.  The bacteria-phenol mix was incubated at 64°C for 6 minutes and mixed by inversion several times every 40 seconds.  The bacteria-phenol mix was chilled on ice for 30 minutes and the layers were separated by centrifugation at 28900 x g for 13 minutes.  The aqueous layer was removed and placed in a clean tube.  An equal volume of chloroform (Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was added to the aqueous layer and mixed well by inversion.  The layers were separated by centrifugation at 20700 x g for 7 minutes.  This aqueous layer was placed into a clean tube and total RNA was precipitated by adding an equal volume of cold isopropanol and 0.1 volumes of 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.4).  RNA was precipitated for one hour at -80°C and then pelleted by centrifugation at 19000 x g for 30 minutes, washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 19000 x g, and the resulting pellets were air-dried for 20 minutes.  The dried pellets were resuspended in RNAse-free water, and subjected to DNAseI treatment.  The DNA was degraded and removed by incubation with 5X DNAseI buffer (50 mM MgCl2, 50 mM Tris-Cl pH 7.5, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), 10 units of DNAseI (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and 10 units of RNAse Inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 37°C for one hour.  Following the DNAseI digestion, the total RNA was further purified using the HighPure RNA isolation kit (Roche, Indianapolis, IN), following manufacturer’s instructions and included the optional (second) DNAseI incubation.  The RNA was eluted with the provided elution buffer, precipitated with 3 volumes of cold 95 % (v/v) ethanol and 0.1 volumes 3 M sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and washed with 80 % (v/v) ethanol.  The pellet was air dried for 15 minutes and then resuspended in The RNA Storage Solution (Ambion, Austin, TX).

      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA extracted from B. melitensis 16M was transcribed into cDNA incorporating 5-(3-aminoallyl)-dUTP (aha-dUTP) for indirect labeling with Alexa Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), a Cy3-like fluorescein.  The cDNA synthesis combined 10 µg of total RNA, 6 µg random primers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 1X first strand buffer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dATP, dTTP and dGTP, 0.3 mM dTTP (PCR grade, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 0.2 mM aha-dUTP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), 400 units SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and 20 units protector RNAse inhibitor (Roche, Indianapolis, IN).  The reaction was incubated at 23°C for one minute and then at 46°C overnight.  The reaction was then treated with 0.4 M NaOH and incubated at 65°C for 15 minutes to stop the reaction and remove residual RNA.    The pH was brought back to neutral with the addition of 0.2M HCl, then the cDNA was purified to remove unincorporated aha-dUTP and free amines using PCR Purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with the modified wash (5 mM KPO4 (pH 8.0) and 80 % (v/v) ethanol) and elution buffers (4 mM KPO4 (pH 8.5)).  The manufacturer’s instructions were modified to include 2 washes with the substituted phosphate wash buffer, and the elution was carried out in 2 steps: 50 µl each elution (yielding 100 µl total) with a one minute incubation of the elution buffer in the column at room temperature before centrifugation.  Alexa-Fluor 555 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) was coupled to the aha-dUTP incorporated into the cDNA following the coupling procedure outlined in the BioPrime® Plus Array CGH Indirect Genomic Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and purified using PCR purification columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following manufacturer’s instructions.  Concentration and labeling efficiency of the labeled cDNA was examined using the Nanodrop® ND-1000 (Nanodrop, Wilmington, DE).  Labeled RNA samples were dried completely (Eppendorf Vacufuge, Westbury, NY) and resuspended in ddH2O immediately before hybridization to the microarrays.

    <Title>Expt 1: The contribution of vjbR and N-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone on gene regulation in Brucella melitensis</Title>

    <Summary>
Quorum sensing (QS) is a communication system in bacteria that regulates gene expression in response to a small diffusible signal indicative of the bacterial population present.  QS has been shown to regulate virulence genes, biofilm formation, cell division and secretion systems in a diverse set of bacteria.  Brucella melitensis produces a QS signaling molecule, N-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (C12-HSL), that interacts with a LuxR transcriptional regulator, VjbR.  Deletion of vjbR has been found to highly attenuate intracellular survival of B. melitensis.  The importance of QS in the regulation of genes necessary for the establishment and maintenance of B. melitensis infection has already been described for the virB and fla operons, however, a complete description of the vjbR regulon has not been described.  Genome mining revealed seven luxR-like genes in B. melitensis, only one of which, vjbR, was confirmed to be attenuated for intracellular survival using macrophage assays.  Using custom B. melitensis microarrays, we compared transcripts from wild type and ∆vjbR strains in the presence and absence of exogenous C12-HSL.  Comparison of the transcriptomes obtained from culture-grown bacteria revealed bi-phasic gene regulation with expression peaks during exponential and early stationary growth phase; characterized by the regulation of 226 and 246 genes (respectively) by VjbR and 349 and 146 (respectively) altered by the addition of C12-HSL.  Comparison of the VjbR and C12-HSL regulated genes provided confirmation that expression of 134 genes are regulated by both conditions with all but 3 genes inversely regulated.  Overall, these results indicate that VjbR is an activator of gene expression at the exponential growth phase and exerts an equal effect on gene expression at the stationary growth phase; while C12-HSL has a repressive effect on gene expression at both growth stages examined and acts as an antagonist to VjbR activity.  Direct transcript analysis comparing ∆vjbR with and without the addition of C12-HSL revealed that the AHL signal is able to direct gene expression in the absence of VjbR and exclusively exerted a positive influence on the expression of 56 genes, including a 93-fold increase in the expression of BabR, a second LuxR homologue.  Genes regulated by these QS components included adhesins, proteases, antibiotic and toxin resistance genes, stress survival aids, including DNA repair genes and protein chaperones, transporters and porins, cellular membrane biogenesis genes, amino acid metabolism and transport, transcriptional regulators, and energy production genes.  From these data, we conclude that QS is a global regulator of gene expression, and present potential virulence genes that may provide insight into the bacteria’s ability to establish and maintain the replicative vacuole (BCV) within the host cell.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Samples consist of RNA isolated from Brucella melitensis grown to logarithmic or stationary phase.  RNA was extracted from wild type with and without exogenously added C12-HSL, and a ∆vjbR mutant. There are three biological replicates of each sample.  Every Brucella melitensis open reading frame was printed in quadruplicate on each microarray.  Each replicate was normalized against labeled Brucella melitensis 16M genomic DNA.
