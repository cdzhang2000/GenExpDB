Biological replicate 1 of 7. Comparison between M. tuberculosis CPR like mutant and wild type. Cell culture grew in Dubos medium.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were obtained from at least six slides, including dye swaps. To account for dye swap, the signal channel and control channel measurements for dye swap samples were reversed. Each gene's measured intensity (wild type) was divided by its control channel value (mutant) in each sample to give the ratio of expression; if the control channel were below 10 then 10 was used instead. If the control channel and the signal channel were both below 10 then no data was reported. The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each sample; each measurement for each gene was divided by this synthetic positive control. The percentile was calculated using only genes marked present. This normalizes each array so that the 50th percentile/median measurement (ratio) for each array is equal to 1 and ensures that any systematic effects are removed (caused by scanning, labelling, hybridization, etc.), enabling valid comparison between different arrays as each array is scaled/transformed to have the same median value. Genes were defined as being differentially regulated where there was a greater than twofold change in at least four of the hybridizations and where P &lt; 0.05 by Student's t-test. The t-test was conducted on the six experiments as a group. To limit the list of genes it was arbitrarily limited to those with a 2.4-fold increase or decrease in expression.

The t-test was conducted on the six experiments as a group. To limit the list of genes it was arbitrarily limited to those with a 2.4-fold increase or decrease in expression.

Biological replicate 2 of 7. Comparison between M. tuberculosis wild type and CPR like mutant. Cell culture grew in Dubos medium.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were obtained from at least six slides, including dye swaps. To account for dye swap, the signal channel and control channel measurements for dye swap samples were reversed. Each gene's measured intensity (wild type) was divided by its control channel value (mutant) in each sample to give the ratio of expression; if the control channel were below 10 then 10 was used instead. If the control channel and the signal channel were both below 10 then no data was reported. The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each sample; each measurement for each gene was divided by this synthetic positive control. The percentile was calculated using only genes marked present. This normalizes each array so that the 50th percentile/median measurement (ratio) for each array is equal to 1 and ensures that any systematic effects are removed (caused by scanning, labelling, hybridization, etc.), enabling valid comparison between different arrays as each array is scaled/transformed to have the same median value. Genes were defined as being differentially regulated where there was a greater than twofold change in at least four of the hybridizations and where P &lt; 0.05 by Student's t-test. The t-test was conducted on the six experiments as a group. To limit the list of genes it was arbitrarily limited to those with a 2.4-fold increase or decrease in expression.

Fluorescently labelled cDNA copies of total RNA (5Ð10 ug) were generated by direct incorporation of Cy3- or Cy5-labelled dCTP (Amersham) using 6 ug of random hexamers together with 500 units Superscript RNase H- reverse transcriptase (GibcoBRL), 1x first-strand buffer, 10 mM DTT, dNTPs (40 uM dCTP, 100 uM each of dATP, dGTP, dTTP) and 1.5 nmol Cy3 or Cy5 labelled dCTP. RNA and random primers were heated at 95 C for 5 min in a final volume of 11 ul, snap cooled before adding the remaining components. Incubation was at 25 C for 10 min, followed by 42 C for 90 min. The two labelled samples to be compared (Cy3 and Cy5) were combined and purified using MinElute columns (Qiagen) and the pellets resuspended in 12.5 ul of water, 4x SSC, 0.3% SDS, heated at 95 C for 2 min.

Biological replicate 4 of 7. Comparison between M. tuberculosis CPR like mutant and wild type. Cell culture grew in Dubos medium.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were obtained from at least six slides, including dye swaps. To account for dye swap, the signal channel and control channel measurements for dye swap samples were reversed. Each gene's measured intensity (wild type) was divided by its control channel value (mutant) in each sample to give the ratio of expression; if the control channel were below 10 then 10 was used instead. If the control channel and the signal channel were both below 10 then no data was reported. The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each sample; each measurement for each gene was divided by this synthetic positive control. The percentile was calculated using only genes marked present. This normalizes each array so that the 50th percentile/median measurement (ratio) for each array is equal to 1 and ensures that any systematic effects are removed (caused by scanning, labelling, hybridization, etc.), enabling valid comparison between different arrays as each array is scaled/transformed to have the same median value. Genes were defined as being differentially regulated where there was a greater than twofold change in at least four of the hybridizations and where P &lt; 0.05 by Student's t-test. The t-test was conducted on the six experiments as a group. To limit the list of genes it was arbitrarily limited to those with a 2.4-fold increase or decrease in expression.

Biological replicate 5 of 7. Comparison between M. tuberculosis wild type and CPR like mutant. Cell culture grew in Dubos medium.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were obtained from at least six slides, including dye swaps. To account for dye swap, the signal channel and control channel measurements for dye swap samples were reversed. Each gene's measured intensity (wild type) was divided by its control channel value (mutant) in each sample to give the ratio of expression; if the control channel were below 10 then 10 was used instead. If the control channel and the signal channel were both below 10 then no data was reported. The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each sample; each measurement for each gene was divided by this synthetic positive control. The percentile was calculated using only genes marked present. This normalizes each array so that the 50th percentile/median measurement (ratio) for each array is equal to 1 and ensures that any systematic effects are removed (caused by scanning, labelling, hybridization, etc.), enabling valid comparison between different arrays as each array is scaled/transformed to have the same median value. Genes were defined as being differentially regulated where there was a greater than twofold change in at least four of the hybridizations and where P &lt; 0.05 by Student's t-test. The t-test was conducted on the six experiments as a group. To limit the list of genes it was arbitrarily limited to those with a 2.4-fold increase or decrease in expression.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
DNA microarray experiments were performed using a whole genome microarray of M. tuberculosis H37Rv prepared in the laboratory of Dr P. Butcher (St. George's Hospital Medical School, London).  Hybridization of microarray slides was performed under a coverslip as described (Wilson et al., 1999) in hybridization chambers at 60 C for 16Ð24 h and washed in 1x SSC, 0.005% SDS for 2 min and in 0.06x SSC for 4 min.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Data were obtained from at least six slides, including dye swaps. To account for dye swap, the signal channel and control channel measurements for dye swap samples were reversed. Each gene's measured intensity (wild type) was divided by its control channel value (mutant) in each sample to give the ratio of expression; if the control channel were below 10 then 10 was used instead. If the control channel and the signal channel were both below 10 then no data was reported. The 50th percentile of all measurements was used as a positive control for each sample; each measurement for each gene was divided by this synthetic positive control. The percentile was calculated using only genes marked present. This normalizes each array so that the 50th percentile/median measurement (ratio) for each array is equal to 1 and ensures that any systematic effects are removed (caused by scanning, labelling, hybridization, etc.), enabling valid comparison between different arrays as each array is scaled/transformed to have the same median value. Genes were defined as being differentially regulated where there was a greater than twofold change in at least four of the hybridizations and where P &lt; 0.05 by Student's t-test. The t-test was conducted on the six experiments as a group. To limit the list of genes it was arbitrarily limited to those with a 2.4-fold increase or decrease in expression.

    <Summary>
Deletion of gene Rv3676 in Mycobacterium tuberculosis coding for a transcription factor belonging to the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) family caused growth defects in laboratory medium, in bone marrow-derived macrophages and in a mouse model of tuberculosis. Transcript profiling of M. tuberculosis grown in vitro identified 16 genes with significantly altered expression in the mutant compared with the wild type. Analysis of the DNA sequences upstream of the corresponding open reading frames revealed that 12 possessed sequences related to a consensus CRP binding site that could represent the sites of action of Rv3676. These included rpfA, lprQ, whiB1 and ahpC among genes with enhanced expression in the wild type, and Rv3616c-Rv3613c, Rv0188 and lipQ among genes exhibiting enhanced expression in the mutant. The activity of an rpfA::lacZ promoter fusion was lowered in the Rv3676 mutant and by mutation of the predicted Rv3676 binding site. Moreover, the product of Rv3676 (isolated as a TrxA fusion protein) interacted specifically with the rpfA promoter, and binding was inhibited by mutation of the Rv3676 site. Although Rv3676 retains four of the six amino acid residues that bind cAMP in Escherichia coli CRP addition of cAMP did not enhance Rv3676 binding at the rpfA promoter in vitro. In summary, it has been shown that Rv3676 is a direct regulator of rpfA expression, and because rpfA codes for a resuscitation promoting factor this may implicate Rv3676 in reactivation of dormant M. tuberculosis infections.
