    <Manufacture-Protocol>
The LSUHSC-S_Shelver_GBS_5K_V1.0 was designed according to standard Affymetrix GeneChip protocols.  The array covers the ORFs of Group B Streptococcus (GBS) strain COH1 and 24 PM/MM 25-mer probes were utilized for each ORF.  Probe selection was conducted by Affymetrix.  Each chip contains two copies of each probe.  The chip was manufactured by Nimblegen for Affymetrix via the Affymetrix NimbleExpress program.

Strain COH1, wild-type clinical isolate.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Group B Streptococcus (GBS) strains were cultured in Todd Hewitt broth (THB) to an O.D.600 = 0.3.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
50 ml of cells (O.D.600 = 0.3) were harvested by centrifugation. GBS cells were then placed in a 950 ul suspension of QBio lysing matrix B, 50mM sodium acetate pH 4.0, 0.5% SDS, and 25% acidic phenol (Amresco; Solon, OH). Cells were mechanically disrupted with the lysing matrix using a FastPrep® 120 device (MP Biomedicals; Solon, OH) with a speed setting of 5 and pulse length of 22 s. The mixture was separated by centrifugation for 10 minutes. RNA was precipitated by adding sodium acetate (pH 5.2) to a final concentration of 0.3M and adding 2 volumes of 100% ethanol. One ml of Trizol reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. 200 ul of chloroform was added, shaken vigorously, and allowed to remain at room temperature for 2 minutes. The mixture was centrifuged for ten minutes, the aqueous phase was recovered and RNA was precipitated with an equal volume of 100% isopropanol. The pellet was air-dried and resuspended in 50 ul DEPC-treated water. Residual DNA was removed using DNaseI (Promega) and subsequent clean-up with a RNEasy mini spin column (Qiagen).
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA was synthesized from 10 ug of total RNA using Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). Carryover RNA was degraded with 1 N NaOH followed by 1 N HCl. cDNA was purified and concentrated using a MinElute PCR Purification kit (Qiagen). Samples were fragmented with DNase I (Promega; Madison, WI) and biotin end-labelled with GeneChip DNA Labeling Reagent (Affymetrix).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A hybridization cocktail containing 3.9 ug labelled cDNA was hybridized to the arrays. Hybridization was performed for 16 hours with a rotation of 60 rpm at a temperature of 45oC in a GeneChip Hybridization Oven 640 (Affymetrix). Arrays were washed and stained with a streptavidin-phycoerythrin conjugate using predefined protocols with a GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (protocol ProkGE-WS2_450).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Arrays were scanned with a GeneChip Scanner 300 7G (Affymetrix). 
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 2.
Scanned microarray images were analyzed using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) 1.4 (Affymetrix).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Expression signals were calculated using the MAS5 statistical algorithm with the Affymetrix GCOS software version 1.4. Signal values were globally scaled to an intensity value of 500.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 2 of 2.
Scanned microarray images were analyzed using GeneChip Operating Software (GCOS) 1.4 (Affymetrix).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
Expression signals were calculated using the MAS5 statistical algorithm with the Affymetrix GCOS software version 1.4. Signal values were globally scaled to an intensity value of 500.

    <Summary>
The purpose of this study was to identify Group B Streptococcus (GBS) genes that are controlled by the CiaR response regulator.  Deletion of the GBS ciaR gene resulted in a significant decrease in intracellular survival within neutrophils, murine macrophages, and human BMEC, which was linked to increased susceptibility to killing by antimicrobial peptides, lysozyme, and reactive oxygen species.  Furthermore, competition experiments in mice showed that wild-type GBS had a significant survival advantage compared to the isogenic ciaR mutant.  Microarray analysis comparing gene expression between the wild-type and ciaR mutant strains revealed several CiaR-regulated genes that may contribute to GBS stress tolerance and subversion of host defenses.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Two cultures each of the wild-type GBS strain (COH1) and the isogenic ciaR mutant were grown in Todd-Hewitt broth to an optical density of 0.3.  Cells were disrupted by shaking with glass beads and RNA was isolated by a Trizol method.  A custom Affymetrix chip with a design based on the COH1 genomic sequence was used to analyze gene expression.
