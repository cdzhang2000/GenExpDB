    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

Amino-allyl labeled cDNA was dried and resuspended in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.3 and coupled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Uncoupled dye was removed by another purfication using the PCR cleanup kit. Concentration of cDNA and amount of incoporated dye was measured for each sample using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Ambion).

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

    <Description>
There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

Amino-allyl labeled cDNA was dried and resuspended in 0.1M sodium carbonate pH 9.3 and coupled with either Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, N.J.). Uncoupled dye was removed by another purfication using the PCR cleanup kit.

Arrays were cross-linked by exposure to 600 mJ UV before blocking in 1% SDS, 5× SSC, and 1 mg/mL BSA at 42°C for 1 hour. After blocking, arrays were washed 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC and 2× 30 s in H2O. Dried arrays were placed into hybridization cassettes (TeleChem International, Sunnyvale, Calif.) and the cDNA samples were suspended in 10 mM EDTA, denatured at 95°C for 5 min and then mixed with 40 uL of SlideHyb buffer 1 (Ambion) and loaded under a coverslip onto the array. Hybridizations were carried out at 47°C for 16–18 h. After hybridization, arrays were washed in 2× SSC, 0.5% SDS 37C for 5 min, followed by 2× 5 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS 37°C, and then 2 × 2.5 min in room temperature 0.1× SSC. Arrays were scanned using an Axon 4000b scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, Calif) and images were analyzed using GenePix 6.0 (Molecular Devices).

There are probes on the array that target three different E. coli genomes. Those that were specific for genomes other than Sakai were excluded from the analysis.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The microarray data were analyzed using R (v. 2.2.1) and the MAANOVA (v. 0.98.8) package. Raw intensity values from replicate probes were averaged and log2 transformed after normalization with the pin-tip LOWESS method. The normalized intensity values were fitted to a mixed model ANOVA considering array and biological replicates as random factors and dye, strain and growth phase as fixed factors. The linear model tested was Y (intensity) = array + dye + strain (wild type or mutant) + growth phase (exponential or stationary) + strain*growth phase + sample (biological replicate) + error. Significant differences in expression due to strain, growth phase and strain*growth phase were determined using the Fs test in MAANOVA which uses a shrinkage estimator for gene-specific variance components that makes no assumption about the variances across genes with 500 random permutations to estimate the p-values. The q-value package in R was used for determining the false discovery rate (FDR).

    <Title>The RpoN Regulon of Escherichia coli O157:H7</Title>

    <Summary>
There is increasing evidence to support a role for sigma factor 54 (RpoN) in the regulation of stress resistance factors and protein secretion systems important to bacterial transmission and pathogenesis.  In enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7, acid resistance and type III secretion are essential determinants of gastric passage and colonization.  This study thus described the transcriptome of an rpoN null strain of E. coli O157:H7 
(EcJR-8) to determine the influence of RpoN on virulence and stress resistance gene regulation, and further explored its contribution to glutamate-dependent acid resistance (GDAR).  Inactivation of rpoN resulted in the growth phase-dependent, differential expression of 104 genes.  This included type III secretion structural and regulatory genes encoded on the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE), as well as GDAR genes gadA, gadBC and gadE.  Upregulation of gad transcript levels in EcJR-8 during logarithmic growth correlated with increased GDAR and survival in a model stomach.  Acid susceptibility was reconstituted in EcJR-8 complemented in trans with wild-type rpoN.  Acid resistance in EcJR-8 was dependent on exogenous glutamate, gadE and rpoS, but was independent of hns.  Results also suggest that GDAR may be controlled by RpoN at multiple regulatory levels.  This study supports the hypothesis that RpoN is an important regulator of virulence and stress resistance factors in E. coli O157:H7, and is the first to examine the mechanism by which it represses GDAR.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Hybridizations measured transcriptional differences between an rpoN null and wild-type (WT) strain of E. coli O157:H7 Sakai at logarithmic and transition phase.  Image files (TIFF) of hybridized microarray slides were generated using an Axon 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices), and analyzed using GenePix Pro software (Molecular Devices, ver. 6.0).  The resulting microarray intensity data was log2-transformed, and normalized using the LOWESS algorithm in MAANOVA ver. 0.98-8 (R ver. 2.2.1).
