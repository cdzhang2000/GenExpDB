    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

The overnight culture (1 mL of OD: 7.5) was used to inoculate 250 ml of fresh LB medium with 10 g of submerged glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) for forming biofilm.  After incubation for 7h at 37C with shaking (250 rpm), the glass wool was carefully and quickly removed and rinsed with 100 ml of sterile 0.85% NaCl solution at 0C.  Biofilm cells were removed by sonicating the glass wool in 200 ml of sterile 0.85% NaCl solution at 0C.  After breaking the cells with a bead beater, the total RNA was isolated with Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Cat#74104)

      <Label-Protocol>
Following affymetrix protocol. cDNA was synthesized first using Promega M-MLV Reverse transcriptase (Cat#M1705). After removing RNA, DNA fragmentation was performed to obtain and 50-200 base cDNA fragments. The fragmented cDNA was labelled with Biotin-ddUTP using Enzo BioArray Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix, P/N 900181)

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Following affymetrix protocol. Prepared hybridization cocktail for Single Probe Array (169 Format) including 1 X hybridization buffer, 50 pM B2 Control Oligo, 0.1 mg/mL Herring Sperm DNA, 0.5 mg/mL BSA, and at least 1 ug of fragmented and labelled cDNA.
After loading of hybridization coctail in Affymetrix E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, the hybridization was performed at 45C, with 60 rpm for 16 hours.
After hybridization, the probe array was washed and stained using Affymetrix Genechip Fluidics Station 450 and the software GenomeChipOperating Software (GCOS)

    <Scan-Protocol>
Following affymetrix protocol. After washing and staining, the probe array was scanned using Affymetrix Genechip scanner GCS3000 7G system and the software GenomeChipOperating Software (GCOS)
