    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

An overnight culture grown at 37°C was diluted 100-fold into 5 ml of LB broth and was allowed to grow to mid-log phase (OD600 0,6). Cultures were centrifuged and RNAs were isolated by using the RiboPure™-Bacteria Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, with the exception that the DNAse 1 treatment was performed twice.

    <Title>Genome-wide transcriptional response of an Avian Pathogenic Escherichia coli (APEC) Pst Mutant</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE9178</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19038054</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Many reports show an association between the Pst system, the Pho regulon related genes and bacterial virulence. Our previous results showed that a functional Pst system is required for full virulence, resistance to serum, polymyxin B and acid shock. However, the interplay between the Pst system and virulence has an unknown molecular basis. To understand global APEC virulent strain responses to Pho regulon activation, we conducted transcriptome profiling experiments comparing the APEC chi7122 strain and its isogenic Pst mutant grown in rich phosphate medium using the Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array. The Affymetrix GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains the genome of the E. coli MG1655 and three pathogenic E. coli strain (EDL933, Sakai and CFT073) representing 20,366 genes. While comparing genes expression between Pst mutant and the wild type chi7122 strain, 471 genes are either up- (254) or down-regulated (217) of at least 1.5-fold, with a p-value inferior or equal to 0.05 and a false discovery rate of 2.71%.
Keywords: Escherichia coli, phosphate starvation response, Pho regulon, Pst system, Affymetrix, transcriptional analysis
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
RNA extraction was performed onto the chi7122 and K3 strains on four biological replicates. An overnight culture grown at 37°C was diluted 100-fold into 5 ml of LB broth and was allowed to grow to mid-log phase (OD600 0,6). Cultures were centrifuged and RNAs were isolated by using the RiboPure™-Bacteria Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX), according to the manufacturer’s recommendations, with the exception that the DNAse 1 treatment was performed twice. RNA extractions were performed on four different days (the chi7122 and K3 RNA were extracted at the same time) and a total of eight hybridizations were performed. Hybridization was carried out at McGill University &amp; Genome Quebec Innovation Centre according to the Affymetrix recommendation (Affymetrix Expression Manual Section 3 701029 rev. 4). GeneChip scan was carried out at McGill University &amp; Genome Quebec Innovation Centre according to the Affymetrix recommendation (Affymetrix Expression Manual Section 3 701029 rev. 4), and data were processed using the FlexArray software (Michal Blazejczyk, Mathieu Miron, Robert Nadon (2007). FlexArray: A statistical data analysis software for gene expression microarrays. Genome Quebec, Montreal, Canada). Raw data were normalized using the RMA algorithm and log2 were generated. The expression value was generated by subtracting the mean value of each replicate of the mutant strain by wild-type strain.
