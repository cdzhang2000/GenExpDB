    <Manufacture-Protocol>
1.Oligos are arrayed in Greiner 384-well flat-bottom plates. Each well contains 600 pmol of 70-mer oligo.
2. Resuspend oligos in 3X SSC to 40 uM shake overnight at 4 degrees and rearray 5 µL into 384-well, Genetix polystyrene V-bottom plates (cat# X6004).
3. Seal plates and store at -20 degrees until ready to print.
4. Day of print, thaw plates and centrifuge plates at 2000 rpm for 2 minutes.
5. Remove seals and place plate in the plate cassette.
6. Arrays are spotted using a Virtek robot and the software that runs the system is VersArray ChipWriter Pro 2.1.1
7. Make sure plates rest behind both holding clips in the cassettes. Push plates back into the cassettes as far as they will go, putting them in the proper position for the server arm.
8. After the print run is completed, remove plates, seal and store at -20 degrees.
9. For each subsequent preparation of these plates for a print run, verify if any evaporation has occured.  Add water to the wells if necessary.  The amount of water should be decreased by 0.25 µL per print run, as this is the amount drawn up by the pin capillary during each print.

Mean fluorescence values for each spot, minus the surrounding background were used in the analysis.  Spots flagged as misrepresentative or those with a negative value following background correction were subsequently excluded from further analysis.  The fluorescence intensity ratios (Cy3/Cy5 or Cy5/Cy3, representing test/reference) were calculated for each spot, log10 transformed and then normalized with respect to the mean value of all fluorescence ratios. A Z- score [Z = (log10 fluorescence ratio - mean)/standard deviation] was calculated for each spot.

Microarray hybridization was carried out in GE Healthcare hybridization buffer in the presence of yeast tRNA (0.2µg ml-1) at 42°C for 16 hours.  Following hybridization, microarray slides were washed three times (15 mins/wash) with 0.5X SSC + 0.01% SDS, 0.06X SSC + 0.01% SDS and 0.06X SSC.

    <Data-Processing>
Mean fluorescence values for each spot, minus the surrounding background were used in the analysis.  Spots flagged as misrepresentative or those with a negative value following background correction were subsequently excluded from further analysis.  The fluorescence intensity ratios (Cy3/Cy5 or Cy5/Cy3, representing test/reference) were calculated for each spot, log10 transformed and then normalized with respect to the mean value of all fluorescence ratios. A Z- score [Z = (log10 fluorescence ratio - mean)/standard deviation] was calculated for each spot.

    <Summary>
Genomic comparisons among PDIM positive and negative isolates.
Standard in vitro exponential phase cultures of M. tuberculosis H37Rv ATCC27294 were plated on 7H11 plates. Individual colonies were sub-cultured in 7H9 broth and metabolically labeled with [14C] propionic acid. The apolar lipid fraction was then extracted from those cultures and assayed for PDIM (phthiocerol dimycocerosate) content via TLC. Individual isolates producing and deficient in PDIM were selected for performing genomic comparisons. 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Four M. tuberculosis clones derived from the same parental strain were compared. Two of them were PDIM producers while the other two were PDIM deficient. Two replicates were performed for each comparison.
