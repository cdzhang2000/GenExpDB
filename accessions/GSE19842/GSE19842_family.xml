    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Fragmented end-labeled cDNA was hybridized to the GeneChip® E.coli  Genome arrays for 16 hours at 45 ℃ and 60 rpm as described in the Gene Chip Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Affymetrix)

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
After the final wash &amp; staining step, Affymetrix GeneChip® E.coli Genome array was scanned using Affymetrix Model 3000 G7 scanner and the image data was extracted through Affymetrix Commnad Console software. The raw .cel file generated through above procedure meant expression intensity data and was used for the next step.
Expression data were normalized using the Affymetrix microarray suite 5(MAS5) algorithm implemented in Affymetrix expression console software .  To reduce noise for the significance analysis, probe sets that did not show detection call rate at least 50% of the samples in the comparison were filtered out. Highly expressed genes that showed a 2-fold change in expression were selected. 
The web-based tool, DAVID (the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery) was used to perform the biological interpretation of differentially expressed genes. Then, these genes were classified based on the information of gene function in Gene ontology database.

    <Title>The effect of IAN on E. coli O157:H7 EHEC biofilm formation</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE19842</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>20649646</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Intercellular signal indole and its derivative hydroxyindoles inhibit Escherichia coli biofilm and diminish Pseudomonas aeruginosa virulence.  However, indole and bacterial indole derivatives were unstable in microbial community due to the widespread of diverse oxygenases that could quickly degrade them.  Hence, we sought to identify novel non-toxic, stable, and potent indole derivatives from plant sources for inhibiting biofilm formation of E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa PAO1.  Here, plant auxin 3-indolylacetonitrile (IAN) was found to inhibit biofilm formation of both E. coli O157:H7 and P. aeruginosa without affecting its growth.  IAN inhibited biofilms more effectively than indole for both E. coli and P. aeruginosa.  Additionally, IAN decreased the production of virulence factor pyocyanin in P. aeruginosa.  DNA microarray analysis indicated that IAN repressed genes involved in curli formation and glycerol metabolism, while IAN induced indole-related genes and prophage genes in E. coli.  It appears that IAN inhibits biofilm formation of E. coli by reducing curli formation and inducing indole production.  Furthermore, unlike bacterial indole derivatives, plant-originated IAN was stable in the presence of either E. coli or P. aeruginosa.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
For the microarray experiments, E. coli O157:H7 were inoculated in 25 ml of LB medium in 250 ml shake flasks with overnight cultures that were diluted 1:100.  IAN (100 μg/ml) dissolved in 25 μl DMSO or 25 μl DMSO alone as a control was added.  Cells were cultured in LB at 37C with 250 rpm shaking until an absorbance of 1.0 at 600 nm.  Cells were immediately chilled with dry ice and 95% ethanol (to prevent RNA degradation) for 30 sec before centrifugation in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 13,000 g for 2 min; cell pellets were frozen immediately with dry ice and stored -80°C.  RNA was isolated using Qiagen RNeasy mini Kit (Valencia, CA, USA).  RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 bioanalyser using the RNA 6000 Nano Chip (Agilent Technologies, Amstelveen, The Netherlands), and quantity was determined by ND-1000 Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Inc., DE, USA).
