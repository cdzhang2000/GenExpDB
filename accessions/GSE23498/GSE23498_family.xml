      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 ul of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 ul were used for quantification and another 2 ul were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

      <Label>Cy3</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ng of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ng of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

Aminosilane-coated slides were prehybridized in 5x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) (Invitrogen), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42 C degree for 60 min.  The slides then were washed at room temperature with distilled water, dipped in isopropanol, and allowed to dry.  Equal volumes of the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined, dried and then resuspended in a solution of 40% formamide, 5x SSC, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Resuspended probes were heated to 95 C degree  prior to hybridization.  The probe mixture then was added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize overnight at 42 C degree.   Hybridized slides were washed sequentially in solutions of 1x SSC-0.2% SDS, 0.1x SSC-0.2% SDS, and 0.1x SSC at room temperature, then dried in air.

DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

Aminosilane-coated slides were prehybridized in 5x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) (Invitrogen), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42 C degree for 60 min.  The slides then were washed at room temperature with distilled water, dipped in isopropanol, and allowed to dry.  Equal volumes of the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined, dried and then resuspended in a solution of 40% formamide, 5x SSC, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Resuspended probes were heated to 95 C degree  prior to hybridization.  The probe mixture then was added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize overnight at 42 C degree.   Hybridized slides were washed sequentially in solutions of 1x SSC-0.2% SDS, 0.1x SSC-0.2% SDS, and 0.1x SSC at room temperature, then dried in air.

RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

Aminosilane-coated slides were prehybridized in 5x SSC (1x SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) (Invitrogen), 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and 1% bovine serum albumin at 42 C degree for 60 min.  The slides then were washed at room temperature with distilled water, dipped in isopropanol, and allowed to dry.  Equal volumes of the appropriate Cy3- and Cy5-labeled probes were combined, dried and then resuspended in a solution of 40% formamide, 5x SSC, and 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate.  Resuspended probes were heated to 95ºC prior to hybridization.  The probe mixture then was added to the microarray slide and allowed to hybridize overnight at 42 C degree.   Hybridized slides were washed sequentially in solutions of 1x SSC-0.2% SDS, 0.1x SSC-0.2% SDS, and 0.1x SSC at room temperature, then dried in air, and scanned with an Axon GenePix 4000 scanner (http://intranet.jtc.jcvsf.org/sops/M008.pdf).  All wash buffers were supplemented with 1-ml of 0.1M DTT per liter of wash buffer.

      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted from Mtb as follows: an equal volume of 4 M guanidinium isothiocyanate (GTC), 0.5% sodium N-lauryl sarcosine, 25 mM trisodium citrate) was added to cultures to arrest transcription, and cells were collected by centrifugation at 2,885 x g. Bacterial were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and bead beat with zirconia silica beads (BioSpec Products) in a BioSpec Mini Bead Beater two times for 30 s, with 1 min cooling on ice in between. Samples were either stored at -80 C degree or used immediately. Samples were centrifuged for 5 min at 16,100 5 g at 4 C degree to pellet cellular debris. 300 ml of chloroform was added to PhaseLock tubes (Heavy 2 ml, 5Prime) after which the TRIzol samples were added. Tubes were vigorously inverted for 15 s and allowed to rest at RT for 5 min. Tubes were centrifuged for 10 min at 10,500 g at 4 C degree. The aqueous phases were added to microfuge tubes containing 270 ml isopropanol and 270 ml high salt solution (0.8 M trisodium citrate, 1.2 M NaCl) and vortexed for 5 s. After a 10 min incubation at RT, tubes were microcentrifuged at 16,100 g for 10 min at 4 C degree to pellet RNA. RNA pellets were washed with 1 ml of 75% ethanol and centrifuged at 7,500 g for 5 min at 4 C degree. Pellets were allowed to dry by air and resuspended in 50 µl of RNA storage buffer (Ambion). 2 µl were used for quantification and another 2 µl were added to 80% formamide/ 20% loading dye to check RNA integrity on an (1.6%) agarose gel. The purification process was repeated two times to obtain DNA-free RNA. RNA aliquots were stored at -80 C degree.

      <Label-Protocol>
DNA probes for microarray experiments were generated by adding 2 ug of total RNA in a mixture containing 6 ug of random hexamers (Invitrogen), 0.01 M dithiothreitol, an aminoallyl-deoxynucleoside triphosphate mixture containing 25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP, and 10 mM amino-allyl-dUTP (aa-dUTP) (Sigma), reaction buffer, and 400 units of SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) at 42 C degree overnight. The RNA template then was hydrolyzed by adding NaOH and EDTA to a final concentration of 0.2 and 0.1 M, respectively, and incubating at 70 C degree for 15 min. Unincorporated aa-dUTP was removed with a Minelute column (Qiagen). The probe was eluted with a phosphate elution buffer (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5, in ultrapure water), dried, and resuspended in 0.1 M sodium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0). To couple the amino-allyl cDNA with fluorescent labels, normal human serum-Cy3 or normal human serum-Cy5 (Amersham) was added at room temperature for 1h. Uncoupled label was removed using the Qiagen Minelute column (Valencia, CA).

    <Summary>
In this study, we report the identification of a five-locus copper-inducible regulon in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The identification of a copper responsive regulon unique to pathogenic Mycobacteria suggests copper homeostasis must be maintained during an infection.
