    <Data-Processing>
Dual-channel array images were analyzed with ArrayPro 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics Inc.). Spots were screened visually to identify those of low quality. Slide data were processed with MicroPreP. Prior to analysis, automatically and manually flagged spots and spots with very low background subtracted signal intensity (5% of the weakest spots [sum of Cy3 and Cy5 net signals]) were filtered out of all data sets.Net signal intensities were calculated by grid-based background subtraction. A grid-based Lowess transformation was performed for slide normalization, negative and empty values were removed, and outliers were removed by the deviation test. Expression ratios of copY mutant strain over the D39 wild-type strain were calculated. Further analysis was performed with a Cyber-T Student t test for paired data.
