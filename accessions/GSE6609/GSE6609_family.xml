Microarrays are printed with an Omnigrid robotic arrayer by Genomic Solutions (http://www.genomicsolutions.com) that is fitted with a printhead and 16 SMP3 print tips from Telechem (http://www.arrayit.com).
The E. coli microarray (Ecab) probe set is based on 70mer oligonucleotides from Operon's E. coli Genome Oligo Set Version 1.0 (http://omad.operon.com/download/index.php).
Oligonucleotide probes are distributed into 384-well polypropylene plates (Genetix, 384 micro array) and dissolved in print buffer (150mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.5, 4% sodium sulfate, 0.0001% N-lauryl sarcosyl) to a normaliz
The Ecab microarray spot densities are 200 microns (center-to-center).
The microarrays are printed on Epoxy Slides from Corning (Catalog # 40042) and treated by a method that is an adaptation of the manufacturer's instructions to allow higher throughput processing.

Cells were harvested on days 1 and 3 of glucose starvation, with samples taken from the
same cultures used for the viability assay. For each experimental condition, 15 aliquots of
1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA
was washed with 70 percent ethanol, resuspended in 30 ul water, and held at 4 deg. C for

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-
labeled samples were mixed and then concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 centrifigal
concentrator (10,000 MW cut-off; Vivascience). 400 ul TE buffer was added (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 x
g. The flow-through was discarded and 400 ul fresh TE was added to each tube and
mixed by pipette. These spinning and washing steps were repeated 3 more times, the
sample transferred to a new Vivaspin 500, washed with TE buffer, and centrifuged twice
more. The flow-through was again discarded, and sample was transferred to a fresh tube
and its volume adjusted to 9 ul by adding TE or by vacuum centrifugation, as appropriate.

Buffer (30 mM sodium citrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50% formamide, 0.4% SDS,
pH 7.0) was held at 42 deg. C. Twelve ul was added to each sample along with 3 ul of
1:1 salmon sperm/tRNA blocker, heated for 2 min at 98 deg. C, centrifuged for 3 min at
14,000 x g, and then  20 ul was transferred into a microarray hybridization chamber
(MAUI Mixer, Biomicro Systems).  After overnight hybridization at  45 deg. C, slides
were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm
and increasing to 580 in increments of approximately 100 rpm. Once dry, the slides were
removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro software (version 5.1, Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices). Relative mRNA expression levels measured by
each probe spot were estimated by using median pixel intensity minus the mean
background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,
SAS).

Cells were harvested on days 1 and 3 of glucose starvation, with samples taken from the
same cultures used for the viability assay. For each experimental condition, 15 aliquots of
1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA
was washed with 70 percent ethanol, resuspended in 30 ul water, and held at 4 deg. C for

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-
labeled samples were mixed and then concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 centrifigal
concentrator (10,000 MW cut-off; Vivascience). 400 ul TE buffer was added (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 x
g. The flow-through was discarded and 400 ul fresh TE was added to each tube and
mixed by pipette. These spinning and washing steps were repeated 3 more times, the
sample transferred to a new Vivaspin 500, washed with TE buffer, and centrifuged twice
more. The flow-through was again discarded, and sample was transferred to a fresh tube
and its volume adjusted to 9 ul by adding TE or by vacuum centrifugation, as appropriate.

Buffer (30 mM sodium citrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50% formamide, 0.4% SDS,
pH 7.0) was held at 42 deg. C. Twelve ul was added to each sample along with 3 ul of
1:1 salmon sperm/tRNA blocker, heated for 2 min at 98 deg. C, centrifuged for 3 min at
14,000 x g, and then  20 ul was transferred into a microarray hybridization chamber
(MAUI Mixer, Biomicro Systems).  After overnight hybridization at  45 deg. C, slides
were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm
and increasing to 580 in increments of approximately 100 rpm. Once dry, the slides were
removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro software (version 5.1, Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices). Relative mRNA expression levels measured by
each probe spot were estimated by using median pixel intensity minus the mean
background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,
SAS).

Cells were harvested on days 1 and 3 of glucose starvation, with samples taken from the
same cultures used for the viability assay. For each experimental condition, 15 aliquots of
1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA
was washed with 70 percent ethanol, resuspended in 30 ul water, and held at 4 deg. C for

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-
labeled samples were mixed and then concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 centrifigal
concentrator (10,000 MW cut-off; Vivascience). 400 ul TE buffer was added (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 x
g. The flow-through was discarded and 400 ul fresh TE was added to each tube and
mixed by pipette. These spinning and washing steps were repeated 3 more times, the
sample transferred to a new Vivaspin 500, washed with TE buffer, and centrifuged twice

were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm

Cells were harvested on days 1 and 3 of glucose starvation, with samples taken from the
same cultures used for the viability assay. For each experimental condition, 15 aliquots of
1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA
was washed with 70 percent ethanol, resuspended in 30 ul water, and held at 4 deg. C for
further processing

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-
labeled samples were mixed and then concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 centrifigal
concentrator (10,000 MW cut-off; Vivascience). 400 ul TE buffer was added (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 x
g. The flow-through was discarded and 400 ul fresh TE was added to each tube and
mixed by pipette. These spinning and washing steps were repeated 3 more times, the
sample transferred to a new Vivaspin 500, washed with TE buffer, and centrifuged twice
more. The flow-through was again discarded, and sample was transferred to a fresh tube
and its volume adjusted to 9 ul by adding TE or by vacuum centrifugation, as appropriate.
Samples were then held on ice.

Buffer (30 mM sodium citrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50% formamide, 0.4% SDS,
pH 7.0) was held at 42 deg. C. Twelve ul was added to each sample along with 3 ul of
1:1 salmon sperm/tRNA blocker, heated for 2 min at 98 deg. C, centrifuged for 3 min at
14,000 x g, and then  20 ul was transferred into a microarray hybridization chamber
(MAUI Mixer, Biomicro Systems).  After overnight hybridization at  45 deg. C, slides
were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm
and increasing to 580 in increments of approximately 100 rpm. Once dry, the slides were
removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro software (version 5.1, Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices). Relative mRNA expression levels measured by
each probe spot were estimated by using median pixel intensity minus the mean
background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,
SAS).

1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA
was washed with 70 percent ethanol, resuspended in 30 ul water, and held at 4 deg. C for

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-

were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm
and increasing to 580 in increments of approximately 100 rpm. Once dry, the slides were
removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).

    <Scan-Protocol>
Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro software (version 5.1, Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices). Relative mRNA expression levels measured by
each probe spot were estimated by using median pixel intensity minus the mean
background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,
SAS).

14,000 x g, and then  20 ul was transferred into a microarray hybridization chamber
(MAUI Mixer, Biomicro Systems).  After overnight hybridization at  45 deg. C, slides
were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm
and increasing to 580 in increments of approximately 100 rpm. Once dry, the slides were
removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).

Cells were harvested on days 1 and 3 of glucose starvation, with samples taken from the
same cultures used for the viability assay. For each experimental condition, 15 aliquots of
1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA

Cells were harvested on days 1 and 3 of glucose starvation, with samples taken from the
same cultures used for the viability assay. For each experimental condition, 15 aliquots of
1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA
was washed with 70 percent ethanol, resuspended in 30 ul water, and held at 4 deg. C for
further processing

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-
labeled samples were mixed and then concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 centrifigal
concentrator (10,000 MW cut-off; Vivascience). 400 ul TE buffer was added (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 x
g. The flow-through was discarded and 400 ul fresh TE was added to each tube and
mixed by pipette. These spinning and washing steps were repeated 3 more times, the
sample transferred to a new Vivaspin 500, washed with TE buffer, and centrifuged twice
more. The flow-through was again discarded, and sample was transferred to a fresh tube
and its volume adjusted to 9 ul by adding TE or by vacuum centrifugation, as appropriate.
Samples were then held on ice.

Buffer (30 mM sodium citrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50% formamide, 0.4% SDS,
pH 7.0) was held at 42 deg. C. Twelve ul was added to each sample along with 3 ul of
1:1 salmon sperm/tRNA blocker, heated for 2 min at 98 deg. C, centrifuged for 3 min at
14,000 x g, and then  20 ul was transferred into a microarray hybridization chamber
(MAUI Mixer, Biomicro Systems).  After overnight hybridization at  45 deg. C, slides
were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm
and increasing to 580 in increments of approximately 100 rpm. Once dry, the slides were
removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro software (version 5.1, Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices). Relative mRNA expression levels measured by
each probe spot were estimated by using median pixel intensity minus the mean
background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,
SAS).

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-
labeled samples were mixed and then concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 centrifigal
concentrator (10,000 MW cut-off; Vivascience). 400 ul TE buffer was added (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 x
g. The flow-through was discarded and 400 ul fresh TE was added to each tube and
mixed by pipette. These spinning and washing steps were repeated 3 more times, the
sample transferred to a new Vivaspin 500, washed with TE buffer, and centrifuged twice
more. The flow-through was again discarded, and sample was transferred to a fresh tube
and its volume adjusted to 9 ul by adding TE or by vacuum centrifugation, as appropriate.
Samples were then held on ice.

Buffer (30 mM sodium citrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50% formamide, 0.4% SDS,
pH 7.0) was held at 42 deg. C. Twelve ul was added to each sample along with 3 ul of
1:1 salmon sperm/tRNA blocker, heated for 2 min at 98 deg. C, centrifuged for 3 min at
14,000 x g, and then  20 ul was transferred into a microarray hybridization chamber
(MAUI Mixer, Biomicro Systems).  After overnight hybridization at  45 deg. C, slides
were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm

removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).

Cells were harvested on days 1 and 3 of glucose starvation, with samples taken from the
same cultures used for the viability assay. For each experimental condition, 15 aliquots of
1.8 ml (ca. 3E+9 cells) were pipetted into 2.0 ml tubes and immediately centrifuged at
16,000 g for 40 s at room temperature.  The supernatant was discarded, and cell pellets
were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 deg. C.  For RNA isolation,
triplicate samples were prepared by combining cells from 5 tubes each.  Each pellet was
re-suspended in 200 ul Trizol and combined for a total volume of 1 ml, then promptly
chilled in a dry ice/ethanol. bath.  After homogenization with glass beads,. RNA was
isolated by chloroform extraction and precipitation by isopropanol. Precipitated RNA
was washed with 70 percent ethanol, resuspended in 30 ul water, and held at 4 deg. C for

Bacterial RNA was labeled following the protocol of the Microarray Research Facility at
the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, except that no RNase inhibitor
was added.  Briefly, for each sample, 2.5 ug of RNA were reverse-transcribed/labeled
with Cy3, and 2.5 ug were reverse-transcribed/labeled with Cy5. Dyes were obtained
from Amersham Biosciences; all other reagents were from Invitrogen.  Cy3- and Cy5-
labeled samples were mixed and then concentrated in a Vivaspin 500 centrifigal
concentrator (10,000 MW cut-off; Vivascience). 400 ul TE buffer was added (10 mM
Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), and the samples were then centrifuged for 8 min at 12,000 x
g. The flow-through was discarded and 400 ul fresh TE was added to each tube and
mixed by pipette. These spinning and washing steps were repeated 3 more times, the
sample transferred to a new Vivaspin 500, washed with TE buffer, and centrifuged twice
more. The flow-through was again discarded, and sample was transferred to a fresh tube
and its volume adjusted to 9 ul by adding TE or by vacuum centrifugation, as appropriate.
Samples were then held on ice.

Buffer (30 mM sodium citrate, 300 mM sodium chloride, 50% formamide, 0.4% SDS,
pH 7.0) was held at 42 deg. C. Twelve ul was added to each sample along with 3 ul of
1:1 salmon sperm/tRNA blocker, heated for 2 min at 98 deg. C, centrifuged for 3 min at
14,000 x g, and then  20 ul was transferred into a microarray hybridization chamber
(MAUI Mixer, Biomicro Systems).  After overnight hybridization at  45 deg. C, slides
were inserted into a jig and submerged in Buffer A, comprised of 1X SSC and 0.05%
SDS. The adhesive MAUI Mixer lid was removed and the slide placed in a rack in a jar
containing fresh Buffer A. Once all slides were in the rack, they were agitated for 1 min,
transferred to fresh Buffer A, agitated 2 min, transferred to Buffer B (0.1X SSC) for 2
min and then into fresh Buffer B. Slides were  centrifuged for 5 min starting at 220 rpm
and increasing to 580 in increments of approximately 100 rpm. Once dry, the slides were
removed from the centrifuge and scanned on a GenePix4000B Scanner (Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices).
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Image analysis was performed using GenePix Pro software (version 5.1, Axon
Instruments/Molecular Devices). Relative mRNA expression levels measured by
each probe spot were estimated by using median pixel intensity minus the mean
background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,
SAS).

each probe spot were estimated by using median pixel intensity minus the mean
background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,

background intensity. Arrays were normalized using the median spot intensity in
each channel as a scaling factor. Log (base 2) transformation was applied to the
Cy5/Cy3 ratios before further analysis. Correlation and hierarchical clustering
calculations were performed using JMP statistical analysis software (version 5.1,
SAS).

    <Title>Lon Protease Promotes Survival of Escherichia coli During Anaerobic Glucose Starvation</Title>

    <Summary>
In Escherichia coli, Lon is an ATP-dependent protease which degrades misfolded proteins and certain rapidly-degraded regulatory proteins. Given that oxidatively damaged proteins are generally degraded rather than repaired, we anticipated that Lon deficient cells would exhibit decreased viability during aerobic, but not anaerobic, carbon starvation.  We found that the opposite actually occurs.  Wild-type and Lon deficient cells survived equally well under aerobic conditions, but Lon deficient cells died more rapidly than the wild-type under anaerobiosis.  Microarray analysis revealed that genes of the Clp family of ATP-dependent proteases were induced during aerobic growth but not during anaerobic growth.  Thus, Clp may compensate for loss of Lon when cells are in an oxygen containing atmosphere.  Under anaerobic carbon starvation conditions, Lon must be active to support survival.

    <Overall-Design>
Three aliquots of isolated total RNA, drawn from one of four cultures containing 3E+9 cells, were each divided in half. The first half was labeled with Cy5 and the second half was added to a reference pool of RNA. The reference pool, containing an equal amount of RNA from each pooled culture sample, was labeled with Cy3. Triplicate samples yielded three expression measurements per gene for each experimental condition. Five arrays of lower quality, as determined by within-group correlation of log(base 2) ratio (cy5/cy3) measurements of all array features, were excluded from further analysis. Data from the remaining nineteen arrays were grouped as follows:
Group A: day 1, anaerobic, lon(+) (wild-type)
Group B: day 1, anaerobic, lon(-)
Group C: day 1, aerobic, lon(+)
Group D: day 1, aerobic, lon(-)
Group E: day 3, anaerobic, lon(+)
Group F: day 3, anaerobic, lon(-)
Group G: day 3, aerobic, lon(+)
Group H: day 3, aerobic, lon(-).
