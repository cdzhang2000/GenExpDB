The cultures were treated with rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at final concentrations of 30 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Cultures were immediately placed in an ice water bath for 15 minutes after which 7.5 mls were centrifuged in sealed tubes for 10 minutes, 5,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and the cell-containing pellets were suspended in 750 µl of a solution containing a 1:1 ratio of RNA protect (Qiagen) and phosphate buffered saline. After a 5 min incubation period at room temperature the cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The cell pellets were thawed on ice and the cells were suspended in 1.5 ml RLT buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 150 µl β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized with 0.1 mm Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec) in a Mini-Beadbeater-16 (BioSpec) for 4 min. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and integrity of the RNA was determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.

      <Label-Protocol>
Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Two ug of Cy3 labeled ds-cDNAs were transferred to new tubes, dried in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf), and rehydrated in 3.3 ul Sample Tracking Control solution (Roche NimbleGen). Then 8.7 ul hybridization solution containing 6 ul 2X Hybridization Buffer (Roche NimbleGen), 2.4 ul Hybridization Component A (Roche NimbleGen), and 0.3 ul Alignmet Oligo (Roche NimbleGen) was added to each tube. Eight ul of each Cy3 labeled ds-cDNA was transferred to a separate port of a 4-plex Mixer (Roche NimbleGen) which was previously adhered to a 4-plex gene expression array (Roche NimbleGen) designed for C. acetobutylicum. Each quadrant of the array contained 2 replicates of 9 probes approximately 60 bp in length for each of the 3,842 open reading frames annotated in the C. acetobutylicum genome. The arrays were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h in a NimbleGen Hybridization System 4 (Roche NimbleGen) using mix mode B. Following removal of the hybridization chambers the microarray slides were washed using a NimbleGen Wash Buffer Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The cultures were treated with rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at final concentrations of 30 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Cultures were immediately placed in an ice water bath for 15 minutes after which 7.5 mls were centrifuged in sealed tubes for 10 minutes, 5,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and the cell-containing pellets were suspended in 750 µl of a solution containing a 1:1 ratio of RNA protect (Qiagen) and phosphate buffered saline. After a 5 min incubation period at room temperature the cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The cell pellets were thawed on ice and the cells were suspended in 1.5 ml RLT buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 150 µl β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized with 0.1 mm Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec) in a Mini-Beadbeater-16 (BioSpec) for 4 min. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and integrity of the RNA was determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Two ug of Cy3 labeled ds-cDNAs were transferred to new tubes, dried in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf), and rehydrated in 3.3 ul Sample Tracking Control solution (Roche NimbleGen). Then 8.7 ul hybridization solution containing 6 ul 2X Hybridization Buffer (Roche NimbleGen), 2.4 ul Hybridization Component A (Roche NimbleGen), and 0.3 ul Alignmet Oligo (Roche NimbleGen) was added to each tube. Eight ul of each Cy3 labeled ds-cDNA was transferred to a separate port of a 4-plex Mixer (Roche NimbleGen) which was previously adhered to a 4-plex gene expression array (Roche NimbleGen) designed for C. acetobutylicum. Each quadrant of the array contained 2 replicates of 9 probes approximately 60 bp in length for each of the 3,842 open reading frames annotated in the C. acetobutylicum genome. The arrays were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h in a NimbleGen Hybridization System 4 (Roche NimbleGen) using mix mode B. Following removal of the hybridization chambers the microarray slides were washed using a NimbleGen Wash Buffer Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

The cultures were treated with rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at final concentrations of 30 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Cultures were immediately placed in an ice water bath for 15 minutes after which 7.5 mls were centrifuged in sealed tubes for 10 minutes, 5,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and the cell-containing pellets were suspended in 750 µl of a solution containing a 1:1 ratio of RNA protect (Qiagen) and phosphate buffered saline. After a 5 min incubation period at room temperature the cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The cell pellets were thawed on ice and the cells were suspended in 1.5 ml RLT buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 150 µl β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized with 0.1 mm Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec) in a Mini-Beadbeater-16 (BioSpec) for 4 min. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and integrity of the RNA was determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

Two ug of Cy3 labeled ds-cDNAs were transferred to new tubes, dried in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf), and rehydrated in 3.3 ul Sample Tracking Control solution (Roche NimbleGen). Then 8.7 ul hybridization solution containing 6 ul 2X Hybridization Buffer (Roche NimbleGen), 2.4 ul Hybridization Component A (Roche NimbleGen), and 0.3 ul Alignmet Oligo (Roche NimbleGen) was added to each tube. Eight ul of each Cy3 labeled ds-cDNA was transferred to a separate port of a 4-plex Mixer (Roche NimbleGen) which was previously adhered to a 4-plex gene expression array (Roche NimbleGen) designed for C. acetobutylicum. Each quadrant of the array contained 2 replicates of 9 probes approximately 60 bp in length for each of the 3,842 open reading frames annotated in the C. acetobutylicum genome. The arrays were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h in a NimbleGen Hybridization System 4 (Roche NimbleGen) using mix mode B. Following removal of the hybridization chambers the microarray slides were washed using a NimbleGen Wash Buffer Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

The cultures were treated with rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at final concentrations of 30 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Cultures were immediately placed in an ice water bath for 15 minutes after which 7.5 mls were centrifuged in sealed tubes for 10 minutes, 5,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and the cell-containing pellets were suspended in 750 µl of a solution containing a 1:1 ratio of RNA protect (Qiagen) and phosphate buffered saline. After a 5 min incubation period at room temperature the cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The cell pellets were thawed on ice and the cells were suspended in 1.5 ml RLT buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 150 µl β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized with 0.1 mm Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec) in a Mini-Beadbeater-16 (BioSpec) for 4 min. Total RNA was extracted from homogenized cells using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and integrity of the RNA was determined using an Agilent Bioanalyzer.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

Two ug of Cy3 labeled ds-cDNAs were transferred to new tubes, dried in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf), and rehydrated in 3.3 ul Sample Tracking Control solution (Roche NimbleGen). Then 8.7 ul hybridization solution containing 6 ul 2X Hybridization Buffer (Roche NimbleGen), 2.4 ul Hybridization Component A (Roche NimbleGen), and 0.3 ul Alignmet Oligo (Roche NimbleGen) was added to each tube. Eight ul of each Cy3 labeled ds-cDNA was transferred to a separate port of a 4-plex Mixer (Roche NimbleGen) which was previously adhered to a 4-plex gene expression array (Roche NimbleGen) designed for C. acetobutylicum. Each quadrant of the array contained 2 replicates of 9 probes approximately 60 bp in length for each of the 3,842 open reading frames annotated in the C. acetobutylicum genome. The arrays were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h in a NimbleGen Hybridization System 4 (Roche NimbleGen) using mix mode B.

The cultures were treated with rifampicin, chloramphenicol, and phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) at final concentrations of 30 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, and 0.5 mM, respectively. Cultures were immediately placed in an ice water bath for 15 minutes after which 7.5 mls were centrifuged in sealed tubes for 10 minutes, 5,000 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant was decanted and the cell-containing pellets were suspended in 750 µl of a solution containing a 1:1 ratio of RNA protect (Qiagen) and phosphate buffered saline. After a 5 min incubation period at room temperature the cell suspensions were pelleted by centrifugation and stored at -80 °C. The cell pellets were thawed on ice and the cells were suspended in 1.5 ml RLT buffer (Invitrogen) supplemented with 150 µl β-mercaptoethanol and homogenized with 0.1 mm Zirconia/Silica beads (BioSpec) in a Mini-Beadbeater-16 (BioSpec) for 4 min.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

Synthesis of Cy3 labeled cDNA and hybridization to DNA microarrays was performed essentially as described by the NimbleGen Arrays User’s Guide for Gene Expression Analysis (Roche NimbleGen). Double stranded cDNA (ds-cDNA) was synthesized from 10 ug random hexamer primed total RNA using a Superscript Double-Stranded cDNA Synthesis kit (Invitrogen). RNA was then removed by incubating samples with 2 ng/ul (final concentration) of RNase A (Promega) at 37 C for 10 min. The ds-cDNA was purified using a phenol:cholorform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The resulting ds-cDNA pellet was dissolved in 20 ul water and the quality of ds-cDNA was determined by analysis in an Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). Samples were only used if they had a concentration greater than 100 ng/ul, an A260/A280 ratio greater than 1.8, and a median size greater than 400 bp. For each sample, 1 µg of ds-cDNA, 40 ul Cy3-labeled nonamers (TriLink Biotechnologies) (diluted to a concentration of 20 ug/42 ul of 125 mM Tris pH 7.4, 12.5 mM MgCl2, 1.75 ul/ml β-mercaptoethanol), and sufficient water to bring the reaction volume to 80 ul was incubated at 98 C for 10 minutes and then cooled in an ice water bath for 10 min. Ten ul dNTPs (Invitrogen) (10 mM dATP, 10 mM dGTP, 10 mM dTTP, 10 mM dCTP in 1 M Tris HCl pH 7.4, 0.01 M EDTA), 2 ul 50 U/ul Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs), and 8 ul water were added to each reaction. The reactions were incubated at 37 uC in the dark for 2 h. The reactions were stopped by addition of 10 ul 0.5 M EDTA.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Two ug of Cy3 labeled ds-cDNAs were transferred to new tubes, dried in a SpeedVac (Eppendorf), and rehydrated in 3.3 ul Sample Tracking Control solution (Roche NimbleGen). Then 8.7 ul hybridization solution containing 6 ul 2X Hybridization Buffer (Roche NimbleGen), 2.4 ul Hybridization Component A (Roche NimbleGen), and 0.3 ul Alignmet Oligo (Roche NimbleGen) was added to each tube. Eight ul of each Cy3 labeled ds-cDNA was transferred to a separate port of a 4-plex Mixer (Roche NimbleGen) which was previously adhered to a 4-plex gene expression array (Roche NimbleGen) designed for C. acetobutylicum. Each quadrant of the array contained 2 replicates of 9 probes approximately 60 bp in length for each of the 3,842 open reading frames annotated in the C. acetobutylicum genome. The arrays were hybridized at 42 °C for 16 h in a NimbleGen Hybridization System 4 (Roche NimbleGen) using mix mode B. Following removal of the hybridization chambers the microarray slides were washed using a NimbleGen Wash Buffer Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

    <Summary>
Investigation of whole genome gene expression levels in Clostridium acetobutylicum strain 824 grown individually on starch, galactose, lactose, mannose, fructose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, cellobiose, maltose, sucrose 
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
A 33 array study using total RNA recovered from three separate wild-type cultures of Clostridium acetobutylicum 824 grown on each of the following sugars: starch, galactose, lactose, mannose, fructose, glucose, arabinose, xylose, cellobiose, maltose, sucrose.  RNA extraction, cDNA production, and labeling were performed independently on three separate cultures for each carbohydrate.  Each independent sample was hybridized to one array equating to one technical replicate for each biological sample and three biological replicates for each condition tested.  Each array contains 2 replicates of 9 probes approximately 60 bp in length for each of the 3,842 open reading frames annotated in the C. acetobutylicum 824 genome.
