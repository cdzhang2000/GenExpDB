      <Growth-Protocol>
Cells were grown overnight in LB with antibiotics at 37°C with shaking, subcultured into LB without antibiotics and grown to log phase at 37°C with shaking.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 
1.  Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely.  Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols.  
2.  Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C.
3.  Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction.
4.  Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol.
5.  Shake to mix the phases.
6.  Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up.  
7.  Heat for about 15-30 minutes.  The mixture should look like one layer, not two.
8.  Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion).
9.  Place tubes on ice.
10.  Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube.
11.  Mix thoroughly and release gas build up.
12.  Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes.
13.  Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube.  Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA.   Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind.  
14.  Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube.
15.  Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube.
16.  Shake to mix and release gas build up.
17.  Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes.
18.  Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube.  Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 
19.  Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes.
20.  Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube.
21.  Cool on ice for 30 minutes.  Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield.
22.  Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes.  Longer spins will increase RNA yield.
21.  Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 
23.  Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prepping slides for hybridization:
1.  Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath.  
2.  Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C.
3.  Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 
4.  Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol.
5.  Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min.  
6.  Make hybridization buffer:  250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last.   Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter.  
7.  Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend.
8.  Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block.
9.  Add hot probe to center of hot slide.  Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop.  Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified.  
10.  Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight.          
Post-Hybridization and scanning:      
1.  Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low 
stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish.  Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously in large glass dish for 2-3 min.  Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker.  Do not let slides dry out during washing process.    
2.  Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20).
3.  Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high 
stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20).
4.  Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge.
5.  Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm.  6.  Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner.  Slides should be scanned to obtain a ratio between 0.8-1.2 for Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously in large glass dish for 2-3 min. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker  Do not let slides dry out during washing process. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3.

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner. Slides should be scanned to obtain a ratio between 0.8-1.2 for Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence.

CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2.

Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner. Slides should be scanned to obtain a ratio between 0.8-1.2 for Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence.

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner. Slides should be scanned to obtain a ratio between 0.8-1.2 for Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence.

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

Hot phenol/chloroform extract of total RNA: 1. Place 25.0 ml of phenol (Sigma, P4682-400mL) into a glass bottle, cap bottle loosely. Never use ddH20, only use DI water for all array protocols. 2. Place bottle of phenol in boiling water 100°C. 3. Heat phenol for approximately 10 minutes prior to extraction. 4. Transfer 25.0 ml of a bacterial culture into the hot phenol. 5. Shake to mix the phases. 6. Loosen cap every so often to release gas build up. 7. Heat for about 15-30 minutes. The mixture should look like one layer, not two. 8. Transfer mixtures into two “RNase-treated” centrifuge tubes (Ambion). 9. Place tubes on ice. 10. Add 5.0 ml of chloroform to each tube. 11. Mix thoroughly and release gas build up. 12. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 13. Transfer aqueous phases (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

Instead, leave 1-3 mls of the aqueous layer behind. 14. Add 6.25 ml of phenol to each tube. 15. Add 6.25 ml of chloroform to each tube. 16. Shake to mix and release gas build up. 17. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 10 minutes. 18. Transfer each aqueous phase (top layer) to a fresh centrifuge tube. Be careful not to get bottom layer of debris; this will ruin the quality of the RNA. 19. Add 0.1 volume of 3.0 M sodium acetate in DEPC (diethylpyrocarbonate) treated water (Ambion) to each of the tubes. 20. Add an equal volume of isopropanol to each tube. 21. Cool on ice for 30 minutes. Longer incubations do not increase RNA yield. 22. Spin at 10,000 g at 4°C for 60 minutes. Longer spins will increase RNA yield. 21. Remove all of the supernatant, pat inverted tubes onto paper towels to remove excess supernatant being careful not to contaminate RNA or lose RNA pellet, then allow the pellet to air dry upright in uncapped tubes for 5 minutes in the fume hood. 23. Resuspend the pellet in RNase free water containing 200 U/ml RNaseOUT (Invitrogen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prepping slides for hybridization: 1. Warm up slide pre-hybridiztion solution (25% formamide, 5X SSC (Ambion #9763), 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml BSA) to 42°C in a Coplin jar (VWR# 25457-200) in a water bath. 2. Incubate microarray slides in pre-warmed hybridization solution for 60 min at 42°C. 3. Wash arrays 10X in glass Wheaton dishes (Wheaton Science Products #900200) with DI water. 4. Wash arrays 1X with isopropanol. 5. Dry arrays by centrifugation at 1000 rpm for 15-20 min. 6. Make hybridization buffer: 250 μl of formamide, 250 μl of 20X SSC, 490 μl of DI water, and add 10 μl 10% SDS last. Filter hybridization buffer with a 0.45 μm filter. 7. Heat probe at 95°C on heat block for 5-10 min and vortex to resuspend. 8. Warm up hybridization chambers (Corning #2551) with slides inside on heat block. 9. Add hot probe to center of hot slide. Hold cover slip at 45° angle close to slide surface and drop. Add hybridization buffer to the bottom of the chamber to keep it humidified. 10. Close up chambers, cover with foil, weigh down in 42°C water bath, and incubate overnight. Post-Hybridization and scanning: 1. Remove cover slips by holding slides upside down in warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in a large glass dish. Remove fallen cover slip and wash slides vigorously (move back and forth by hand quickly) in large glass dish for 2-3 min. The most important wash is the first wash, because that is when most of the excess dye comes off. Then wash 2 times for 5 min with warm (55°C) low stringency buffer (2X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20) in Wheaton dish on an orbital shaker or by hand on the benchtop mimicking an orbital shaker. Do not use DTT in wash buffers. Slightly old DTT will cause green film on slide, thus ruining the slide. Do not use ddH20 for wash buffers. Do not let slides dry out during washing process. Washing is very important to remove excess dye and decrease background. Extra washes will help remove excess dye and reduce background. 2. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature medium stringency buffer (0.1X SSC and 0.1% SDS in dH20). 3. Wash slides vigorously 2 times for 5 min with room temperature high stringency buffer (0.1X SSC in dH20). 4. Wash slides in water 1 time for 3 min and transfer to centrifuge. 5. Dry slides by centrifugation for 15-20 min at 1000 rpm. 6. Slides should be kept in the dark until they are scanned.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner. Slides should be scanned to obtain a ratio between 0.8-1.2 for Cy3/Cy5 fluorescence.

    <Description>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain. Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The TM4 Microarray Suite produced by TIGR was used for data analysis (Saeed AI, 2003, Biotechniques). Spotfinder was used to assign gene identifiers to spots (circle algorithm) and to flag spots. MIDAS was used to normalize (Lowess (Locfit) and Standard Deviation Regularization) the data. The normalized data was imported into Microsoft Excel. Normalized intensity values for RNA were divided by those for the genomic DNA control for each slide to obtain a ratio. Three sets of ratios were obtained for wild type and three sets of ratios were obtained for a corA strain.

    <Summary>
CorA is the primary Mg2+ channel in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.  A strain lacking corA is attenuated in mice after infection either by oral gavage or intraperitoneal injection.  Microarray studies show that several virulence effectors in Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 and Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 are repressed in the corA strain compared to wild type.  While these results could be sufficient to explain the virulence deficit, the microarray data suggest additional defects that could also contribute.  Motility is significantly reduced in a corA strain whereas enterochelin-dependent iron uptake and curli are upregulated.  A corA strain is defective for invasion of and replication within Caco-2 epithelial cells.  However, a corA strain does not have a significant survival defect in J774A.1 macrophages.  Thus, despite the presence of two other Mg2+ transporters, loss of CorA affects multiple systems which manifests ultimately as a decrease in virulence.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Cells were collected for RNA isolation on three separate days from wild type or corA strains giving six total samples from three independent cultures for each strain.  A single microarray was run for each sample, three for wild type and three for the corA strain.  Genomic DNA from wild type was used as a reference on each slide.  Each microarray consists 3 subarrays.
