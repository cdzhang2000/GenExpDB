The 70-mer oligonucleotide array was constructed, containing 6112 oligonucleotides that sampled chromosomal genes identified in the genome sequences of E. coli strains K-12 MG1655, O157:H7 VT2 Sakai, and O157:H7 EDL933 and plasmid genes from the two genome-sequenced O157:H7 strains (the Operon Array Ready E. coli Oligonucleotide™ set 1.0, Qiagen- Operon, Hilden, Germany). 12 positive and 12 negative control oligonucleotides were also included. The oligonucleotides were resuspended in Corning Pronto! buffer and printed on to Corning UltraGAPS™ slides (Corning B.V Life Sciences, Schiphol-Rijk, Netherlands ) using a Biorobotics Microgrid TAS array printer. Amersham Lucidea  Universal Scorecard™ controls (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) were printed in each subarray. Slides were desiccated under vacuum for 48 hours and then U.V. cross-linked with a dose of 600mJ using a Stratalinker (Stratagene limited, U.K.). Slides were stored under desiccating conditions in the dark until use

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Prior to hybridization, the slides were treated with the
background-reducing Pronto! Pre-Soak System (Corning Life Sciences).
The slides were incubated for 20 min in prewarmed Universal Pre-Soak
solution at 42 °C and washed twice in 0.1_SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 s at room
temperature. Slides were immediately transferred into prewarmed prehybridization
solution (5_ SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin)
and incubated for 2–4 h at 42 °C. The microarray slides were finally washed
at room temperature once in 0.1_ SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min and twice in
0.1_ SSC for 30 s, briefly dipped in water and then ethanol, and dried by
centrifugation for 5 min at 800_g.
For each experiment, equal quantities (80 pmol) of each Cy5- and
Cy3-labeled cDNA were added to a final volume of 80 _l of hybridization
solution containing 25% formamide, 10 mg of bovine serum albumin
(fraction V) per ml, 5_ SSC (1_ SSC is 0.15 M NaCl, 0.015 M
sodium citrate), 0.1% SDS, 8 _g of poly(A), and 1_Denhardt’s solution.
The cDNA probes were denatured at 95 °C for 3 min and hybridized for
16 h at 42 °C. After hybridization was complete, the slides were washed
in 2_SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42 °C for 2 min in 0.1_SSC, 0.1% SDS for 2 min
at room temperature, and finally twice in 0.1_ SSC for 2 min at room
temperature. The microarray slides were dried by centrifugation for 5
min at 800g.

Slide was scanned at 532 and 630 nm by using a
Genepix 4000A scanner (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA).

    <Description>
Recent small molecule inhibitors have been shown to down regulate trascription of TTS in enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). E. coli O157 strain TUV93-0 has been shown to induce Type III secretion (TTS) in MEM-HEPES media. Transcriptional profiling of E.coli TUV93-0 was carried out in MEM-HEPES the prescence and absence of small molecule inhibitors to establish the global effects of these inhibitors in EHEC.

    <Description>
Small molecule inhibitors have recently been shown to down regulate trascription of TTS in enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). E. coli O157 strain TUV93-0 has been shown to induce Type III secretion (TTS) in MEM-HEPES media. Transcriptional profiling of E.coli TUV93-0 was carried out in MEM-HEPES in the prescence and absence of small molecule inhibitors to establish the global effects of these inhibitors in EHEC.

Prior to hybridization, the slides were treated with the
background-reducing Pronto! Pre-Soak System (Corning Life Sciences).
The slides were incubated for 20 min in prewarmed Universal Pre-Soak
solution at 42 °C and washed twice in 0.1_SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 s at room
temperature. Slides were immediately transferred into prewarmed prehybridization
solution (5_ SSC, 0.1% SDS, and 0.1% bovine serum albumin)
and incubated for 2–4 h at 42 °C. The microarray slides were finally washed
at room temperature once in 0.1_ SSC, 0.1% SDS for 1 min and twice in
0.1_ SSC for 30 s, briefly dipped in water and then ethanol, and dried by
centrifugation for 5 min at 800_g.

    <Summary>
The transcriptional profile of Escherichia coli O157 treated with small molecule inhibitors of type III secretion was determined. Four variations of the small molecule inhibitor were assessed for global changes in transcription by treating cells with 20uM of inhibitor or an equivalent volume of DMSO (inhibitor solvent).
Keywords: treatment, dose, Cy3, Cy5, 2-colour
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
For each inhibitor, biological tripicates of treated (20uM inhibitor in DMSO) and untreated (DMSO only) cultures were grown in 25ml of MEM-HEPES supplemented with 0.1% Glucose and 250nM Fe(NO3)2. RNA was extracted from 15ml of culture at OD 0.7 and labeled with Cy5 (treated) and Cy3 (untreated) (excepting ME0055 that was performed as a dye swap). Labeled untreated RNA was pooled prior to hybridisation. Treated RNA (biological replicates) and pooled untreated RNA was hybridised to microarray slides. Slides were scanned using an Axon 4100A scanner and data processed using Genespring GX.
