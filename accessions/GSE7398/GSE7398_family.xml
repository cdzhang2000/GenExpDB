    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

Gene expression data from MG1655 fis::kan  after 90 minutes of growth in LB medium
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.  Data from this sample were collected using Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip (2001; platform ID GPL4940), but because the analysis software failed to recognize the correct platform, we reformatted the data to match the newer (and mostly equivalent) platform GPL199 (Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip version 2, 2002).  Because, however, not all of the probes on the new platform were present on the old platform, data for some probes were unavailable and labeled in the 'remapped' dataset as 'NULL' to indicate they were missing.  While the following data are therefore formatted using ID_REFs that match GPL199, the CEL file contains the raw data (not 'remapped') and thus corresponds to the actual array used (GPL4940, Ecoli antisense chip, 2001).

Gene expression data from MG1655 fis::kan  after 90 minutes of growth in LB medium
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.  Data from this sample were collected using Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip (2001; platform ID GPL4940), but because the analysis software failed to recognize the correct platform, we reformatted the data to match the newer (and mostly equivalent) platform GPL199 (Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip version 2, 2002).  Because, however, not all of the probes on the new platform were present on the old platform, data for some probes were unavailable and labeled in the 'remapped' dataset as 'NULL' to indicate they were missing.  While the following data are therefore formatted using ID_REFs that match GPL199, the CEL file contains the raw data (not 'remapped') and thus corresponds to the actual array used (GPL4940, Ecoli antisense chip, 2001).

Gene expression data from MG1655 wildtype after 90 minutes of growth in LB medium

    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.  Data from this sample were collected using Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip (2001; platform ID GPL4940), but because the analysis software failed to recognize the correct platform, we reformatted the data to match the newer (and mostly equivalent) platform GPL199 (Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip version 2, 2002).  Because, however, not all of the probes on the new platform were present on the old platform, data for some probes were unavailable and labeled in the 'remapped' dataset as 'NULL' to indicate they were missing.  While the following data are therefore formatted using ID_REFs that match GPL199, the CEL file contains the raw data (not 'remapped') and thus corresponds to the actual array used (GPL4940, Ecoli antisense chip, 2001).

Following fragmentation, 10 ug of cRNA were hybridized for 16 hr at 45C on GeneChip E.coli antisense. GeneChips were washed and stained in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 400.

    <Description>
Gene expression data from MG1655 wildtype after 240 minutes of growth in LB medium
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The data were analyzed with Microarray Suite version 5.0 (MAS 5.0) using Affymetrix default analysis settings and global scaling as normalization method.  Data from this sample were collected using Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip (2001; platform ID GPL4940), but because the analysis software failed to recognize the correct platform, we reformatted the data to match the newer (and mostly equivalent) platform GPL199 (Affy Ecoli anti-sense chip version 2, 2002).  Because, however, not all of the probes on the new platform were present on the old platform, data for some probes were unavailable and labeled in the 'remapped' dataset as 'NULL' to indicate they were missing.  While the following data are therefore formatted using ID_REFs that match GPL199, the CEL file contains the raw data (not 'remapped') and thus corresponds to the actual array used (GPL4940, Ecoli antisense chip, 2001).
