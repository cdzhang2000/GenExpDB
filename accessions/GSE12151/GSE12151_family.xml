oligonucleotides purchased from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc.
ARRAY PRINTING
1. Dissolve oligonucleotide probe or PCR product in the appropriate spotting solution to obtain the
recommended final probe concentration:
DNA Probes Final Spotting Concentration
Oligonucleotides 10 - 20 micromolar
PCR products 0.1 – 1 mg/ml
2. Transfer an appropriate volume of probes to a microtiter plate.
3. Set up the arrayer according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. If you were previously
using slides that were thicker than 1.0 mm, for optimal spotting you may need to re-calibrate
the distance between the slide surface and the spotting pins.
4. Print the substrates at 40-50% relative humidity at 20 to 25°C.
DNA IMMOBILIZATION
1. Incubate printed microarray slides in humidity chamber at room temperature for 30 min (see
appendix for details of how to prepare this chamber) to ensure quantitative immobilization.
2. Proceed to washing
HANDLING OF PRINTED ARRAYS
The volume of washing solution should be at least 250 ml per 5 slides. Make sure that slides
do not dry out between washing steps, or between the washing and blocking step.
WASHING
1. Wash slides to remove unbound probe molecules and buffer substances to avoid
interference with subsequent hybridization experiments.
a. Rinse 1 x 5 min in 0.1% Triton X-100 at room temperature.
b. Rinse 2 x 2 min in 1 mM HCl solution at room temperature.
c. Rinse 1 x 10 min in 100 mM KCl solution at room temperature.
d. &lt;optional&gt; Denaturation step for arrays spotted with PCR-probes: 1 x 3 min in
boiling diH2O.
e. Rinse 1 x 1 min in diH2O at room temperature.
2. Proceed to Blocking immediately.
BLOCKING
1. Block the slides with Nexterion® Blocking Solution or alternatively with 50 mM
ethanolamine, 0.1% SDS (add freshly before use) in 0.1 M Tris, pH 9.0 as follows:
a. Incubate slides 1 x 15 min in 1x Nexterion® Blocking Solution at 50°C. The
volume of blocking solution should be at least 100 ml for 5 slides.
b. Rinse 1 x 1 min in diH2O at room temperature.
• Dry the Nexterion® Slide E in an oil-free air or nitrogen stream or by centrifugation
(200 x g for 5 min) to avoid any water stains on the slide surface.
• Proceed to hybridization.
HYBRIDIZATION
1. Re-suspend the dried, labeled target to be applied to the array in Nexterion® Hyb. In
case the target is already dissolved in a different buffer or in water, the sample can
also be diluted in Nexterion Hyb to get at least 90% (v/v) buffer in the final
hybridization solution.
2. Denature the suspended target by heating at 95°C for 3 min in a heat block, perform
a quick spin in a microcentrifuge, then pipette the appropriate volume onto the array
surface of a blocked slide under the coverslip or inside a hybridization station.
POST-HYBRIDIZATION WASHING
1. Place the array into a slide rack and immerse in a dish containing 2x SSC and 0.2%
SDS. Wash in the above solution 1 x 10 min at room temperature.
2. Wash 1 x 10 min in 2x SSC.
3. Wash 1 x 10 min in 0.2x SSC at room temperature.
4. Dry the array in an oil free air or nitrogen stream or by centrifugation (200 x g for 5
min) to avoid water stains on the slide surface.
5. Protect the array from light, dust and abrasion of the array surface, until ready for
scanning. Ensure that the laser and filter set of the scanner is compatible with the
fluorescent labeling of the probe molecules.

    <Title>Modulation of PrfA activity in Listeria monocytogenes upon growth in different culture media</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE12151</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>19047753</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
PrfA activity was studied in L. monocytogenes strain EGD and in an isogenic prfA deletion mutant (EGDΔprfA) carrying multiple copies of the wild-type prfA or the mutant prfA* gene (strains EGDΔprfApPrfA and EGDΔprfApPrfA*) after growth in brain heart infusion (BHI), Luria-Bertani broth (LB) or a defined minimal medium (MM) supplemented either with one of the three PTS-carbohydrates, glucose, mannose and cellobiose, or the non-PTS carbon source glycerol. Low PrfA activity was observed in the wild-type EGD strain in BHI and LB with either of these carbon sources, while PrfA activity was high in minimal medium in presence of glycerol but significantly reduced in presence of cellobiose. The strains expressing the prfA and prfA* gene under the prfA promoters, P1 and P2, produced equally large amounts of PrfA protein and high PrfA activity was observed in strain EGDΔprfApPrfA* under all growth conditions. In contrast, high PrfA activity in strain EGDΔprfApPrfA was only observed when this strain was cultured in BHI but not in LB or MM (in presence of either carbon source). A ptsH mutant (lacking a functional HPr) was able to grow in BHI suggesting that growth of L. monocytogenes in this culture medium is supported by carbon sources whose uptake and metabolism are independent of the PTS pathway. However, this mutant was unable to grow in LB and MM regardless which of the four carbon sources was added, suggesting that uptake of the used carbohydrates and the catabolism of glycerol depend fully on the functional common PTS pathway. Furthermore, the growth rates of L. monocytogenes are strongly reduced in presence of large amounts of PrfA protein when growing MM but less in LB and only slightly in BHI. The expression profiles of the genes encoding PTS permeases were determined in the three strains under various growth conditions. The data suggest that PrfA activity correlates with the expression level and the phosphorylation state of specific PTS permeases.
