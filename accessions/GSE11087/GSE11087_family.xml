    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

Cells were allowed to starve for isoleucine in medium containing 60 uM ile.

Cells were grown in a fermentor with constant O2 saturation and pH was maintained at 7.4. Growth medium was MOPS+glucose+20 AAs (as described by Wanner 1977).  Replete isoleucine was 400 um; isoleucine starvation was with 60 uM. For wildtype, ile replete control, total RNA was extracted in log phase (OD600 of ~0.4).  For ile starved wt and mutants, total RNA was extracted from cells ~40 min after growth arrest.

Cells were grown in a fermentor with constant O2 saturation and pH was maintained at 7.4. Growth medium was MOPS+glucose+20 AAs (as described by Wanner 1977).  Replete isoleucine was 400 um; isoleucine starvation was with 60 uM. For wildtype, ile replete control, total RNA was extracted in log phase (OD600 of ~0.4).  For ile starved wt and mutants, total RNA was extracted from cells ~40 min after growth arrest.

Cells were allowed to starve for isoleucine in medium containing 60 uM ile.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures were grown in a fermentor with constant O2 saturation and pH was maintained at 7.4. Growth medium was MOPS+glucose+20 AAs (as described by Wanner 1977). Replete isoleucine was 400 um; isoleucine starvation was with 60 uM. The control was wildtype grown with replete ile from which total RNA was extracted in log phase (OD600 of ~0.4). For ile starved wt and mutants, total RNA was extracted ~40 min after growth arrest.

Replicates were averaged for ratio calculations. Ratio calculations are provided in the supplementary files on the Series record. For GPL3154, the probeset filter file was created by parsing Affymetrix  E_coli_2.na29.annot.csv  file (create_date=2009-06-30 PDT 20:45:08): 1. Selected all MG1655 locustags from Transcript ID(Array Design) (4070 locustags). 2. Selected all  IG intergenic regions from Transcript ID(Array Design) (1297 Igs). 3. Manually selected based on NC_000913 alignment value (250 locustags).

Cells were allowed to starve for isoleucine in medium containing 60 uM ile.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures were grown in a fermentor with constant O2 saturation and pH was maintained at 7.4. Growth medium was MOPS+glucose+20 AAs (as described by Wanner 1977). Replete isoleucine was 400 um; isoleucine starvation was with 60 uM. The control was wildtype grown with replete ile from which total RNA was extracted in log phase (OD600 of ~0.4). For ile starved wt and mutants, total RNA was extracted ~40 min after growth arrest.

For GPL3154, the probeset filter file was created by parsing Affymetrix  E_coli_2.na29.annot.csv  file (create_date=2009-06-30 PDT 20:45:08): 1. Selected all MG1655 locustags from Transcript ID(Array Design) (4070 locustags). 2. Selected all  IG intergenic regions from Transcript ID(Array Design) (1297 Igs). 3. Manually selected based on NC_000913 alignment value (250 locustags).

Cells were allowed to starve for isoleucine in medium containing 60 uM ile.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Cultures were grown in a fermentor with constant O2 saturation and pH was maintained at 7.4. Growth medium was MOPS+glucose+20 AAs (as described by Wanner 1977). Replete isoleucine was 400 um; isoleucine starvation was with 60 uM. The control was wildtype grown with replete ile from which total RNA was extracted in log phase (OD600 of ~0.4). For ile starved wt and mutants, total RNA was extracted ~40 min after growth arrest.

Replicates were averaged for ratio calculations. Ratio calculations are provided in the supplementary files on the Series record. For GPL3154, the probeset filter file was created by parsing Affymetrix  E_coli_2.na29.annot.csv  file (create_date=2009-06-30 PDT 20:45:08): 1. Selected all MG1655 locustags from Transcript ID(Array Design) (4070 locustags). 2. Selected all  IG intergenic regions from Transcript ID(Array Design) (1297 Igs). 3. Manually selected based on NC_000913 alignment value (250 locustags).

    <Data-Processing>
RMA with quartile normalization according to method of Irizarry et al, 2003. The raw .cel files were processed in RMA using Bioconductor R package: affy Version:1.8.1 Date:2005-09-03, with the option Filter.genes corresponding to the MG1655 subset of probesets from the arrays, as reflected in the sample files. Replicates were averaged for ratio calculations. Ratio calculations are provided in the supplementary files on the Series record. For GPL3154, the probeset filter file was created by parsing Affymetrix  E_coli_2.na29.annot.csv  file (create_date=2009-06-30 PDT 20:45:08): 1. Selected all MG1655 locustags from Transcript ID(Array Design) (4070 locustags). 2. Selected all  IG intergenic regions from Transcript ID(Array Design) (1297 Igs). 3. Manually selected based on NC_000913 alignment value (250 locustags).

    <Summary>
Transcription profiling of wild type, relA-, and relA-spoT-, crp-, dksA-, rpoS-, lrp- mutant strains of E. coli starved for isoleucine
Bacteria comprehensively reorganize their global gene expression when faced with nutrient exhaustion.  In Escherichia coli and other free-living bacteria, the alarmone ppGpp facilitates this massive response by directly or indirectly coordinating the down-regulation of genes of the translation apparatus, and the induction of biosynthetic genes and the general stress response.  Such a large reorientation likely requires the cooperative activities of many different genetic regulators, yet the structure of the transcription network below the level of ppGpp remains poorly defined.  Using isoleucine starvation as an experimental model system for amino acid starvation, we identified genes that required ppGpp, Lrp, and RpoS for their induction.  Surprisingly, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority of genes controlled by Lrp and RpoS required ppGpp for their activation, we found that these two regulons were not induced simultaneously.  The data reported here suggest that metabolic genes, such as those of the Lrp regulon, require only a low basal level of ppGpp for their efficient induction.  In contrast, the RpoS-dependent general stress response is not robustly induced until relatively high levels of ppGpp accumulate.  Here we describe a data-driven conceptual model that explains how bacterial cells allocate transcriptional resources between metabolic and stress survival processes by discretely tuning regulatory activities to a central indicator of cellular physiology.  The regulatory structure that emerges is consistent with a rheostatic model of the stringent response that allows cells to efficiently adapt to a wide range of nutritional environments.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Two experiments were run.
First experiment: WT and several mutant strains were starved for isoleucine (exhaustion of 60 uM ile). 40 minutes after starvation, RNA was extracted. All samples were compared to RNA from rapidly growing WT cells in identical medium replete with isoleucine (400 uM).  16 samples were hybridized: duplicates of 8 strains/conditions.  Wildtype in log phase (OD = 0.4) with replete ile was control for ile starved samples.
Second experiment: WT strain was starved for isoleucine (exhaustion of 60 uM ile).  RNA was extracted at 12 timepoints as the cells entered stationary phase. All samples were compared to RNA from rapidly growing WT cells in identical medium replete with isoleucine (400 uM).  14 samples were hybridized: duplicates of the control condition and single  timepoints during starvation.  Wildtype in log phase (OD = 0.4) with replete ile was control for ile starved samples.
