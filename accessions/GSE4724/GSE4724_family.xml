    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Cells used for expression analysis were grown in minimal medium (Glansdorff, 1965) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (w/v), L-methionine (100ug ml-1). For expression analysis, cells were grown in a rotary shaker at 37°C and harvested by centrifugation at mid-log phase ( (OD) 660nm = 0.5) and the metabolism was quenched in liquid nitrogen.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was isolated using a RNeasy® RNA isolation kit, according to the manufacturer’s specifications (QIAGEN, Germany) and stored in RNase-free water at –80°C. RNA concentration was determined by UV-spectrometry and its quality controlled by agarose gel electrophoresis.
      </Extract-Protocol>
      <Label>Biotin</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
Total RNA was controlled for its integrity and purity using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and a Nanodrop spectrophotometer. Total RNA (10µg) showing no signs of degradation or impurities, was supplemented with Poly-A RNA controls and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primers. After RNA degradation with NaOH, cDNA was purified (MinElute PCR Purification Kit®, QIAGEN), analyzed for yield (30-120µg) and purity (260nm/280nm and 260nm/230nm absorption ratios &gt;1.8), then fragmented using DNase-I (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) and labelled terminally with biotinylated GeneChipÒ DNA Labeling Reagent (Affymetrix, UK).
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
A minimum of 1mg fragmented probe was resuspended in 80 ml hybridization buffer containing 3nM of control oligo B2 (Affymetrix, UK). Hybridization was performed in a rotisserie oven at 45°C for 16 hours. The chips were washed and stained in a GeneChip® Fluidics Station 400™ (Affymetrix, UK) using the Mini_prok2v1 protocol.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The chips were scanned with the GeneChip® Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix, UK).

Initial data analysis was performed using the GeneChip® Operating Software. Microarray quality control parameters were as follow: noise (RawQ) less than 5, background signal less than 40 (100 target intensity for array scaling), consistent numbers of genes detected as present across arrays.

Total RNA (10µg) showing no signs of degradation or impurities, was supplemented with Poly-A RNA controls and reverse transcribed to cDNA using random primers. After RNA degradation with NaOH, cDNA was purified (MinElute PCR Purification Kit®, QIAGEN), analyzed for yield (30-120µg) and purity (260nm/280nm and 260nm/230nm absorption ratios &gt;1.8), then fragmented using DNase-I (Amersham Pharmacia Biosciences) and labelled terminally with biotinylated GeneChipÒ DNA Labeling Reagent (Affymetrix, UK).

Cells used for expression analysis were grown in minimal medium (Glansdorff, 1965) supplemented with 0.5% glucose (w/v), L-methionine (100ug ml-1) and with L-arginine (100ug ml-1). For expression analysis, cells were grown in a rotary shaker at 37°C and harvested by centrifugation at mid-log phase ( (OD) 660nm = 0.5) and the metabolism was quenched in liquid nitrogen.

    <Summary>
Analysis of the response to arginine of the Escherichia coli K-12 transcriptome by microarray hybridization and real-time quantitative PCR provides a first coherent quantitative picture of the ArgR-mediated repression of arginine biosynthesis and uptake genes. Transcriptional repression was shown to be the major control mechanism of the biosynthetic genes, leaving only limited room for additional transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulations. The art genes coding for the specific arginine uptake system are subject to ArgR-mediated repression, 
with a strong repression of artJ, coding for the periplasmic binding protein of the system. The hisJQMP genes of the histidine transporter (part of the LAO uptake system) were discovered to be a part of the arginine regulon. Analysis of their control region with reporter gene fusions and electrophoretic mobility shift in the presence of pure ArgR repressor showed the involvement in repression of the ArgR protein and of an ARG box 120 bp upstream of hisJ. 
No repression of the genes of the AO uptake system was observed. Finally, comparing the time course of arginine repression of gene transcription with the evolution of the specific 
activities of the cognate enzymes showed that while full genetic repression was achieved two minutes after arginine addition, enzyme concentrations were diluted at the rate of cell 
division. This emphasizes the importance of the feedback-inhibition of the first enzymatic 
step of the pathway in controlling the metabolic flow through the biosynthesis in the period following the onset of repression.

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
3 groups of 3 replicate samples were analyzed:
(1) Wild type on minimal medium (strain P4X, slides 1753, 1765, 1989), this created a reference condition

(2) Wild type grown in the presence of arginine (strain P4X plus 100µg/ml of arginine, slides 1754, 1766, 1990), this gave a list of all the genes repressed by the system: ArgR+arginine

(3) Mutant where no active repressor is present; grown in the presence of arginine (strain P4XB2 (argR-) plus 100µg/ml arginine, slides 1992, 1993, 1994). This condition told us which genes are indeed regulated by the system: ArgR+arginine. Those genes are in this case derepressed.
