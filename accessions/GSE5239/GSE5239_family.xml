    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
E. coli samples for RNA extraction were taken during fermentation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at the cultivation temperature (37°C, 10,000 g, 1 min), separated from the supernatant, and rapidly frozen in dry ice. The samples were stored at -70°C until analysis
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were carried out in a 5 l fermentor BIOSTAT B-DCU (Sartorius BBI Systems Inc. Melsungen) at controlled temperature 37°C, pH 7.0, and dissolved oxygen tension 30%. The culture volume was 2 l. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. The synthetic culture medium had the following composition (g l-1): 8, glucose; 14.6, K2HPO4; 3.6, NaH2PO4·H2O; 2.68, (NH4)2SO4; 2, Na2SO4; 1, MgSO4; 1, Na-citrate; 0.5, NH4Cl; 2 ml of 10 mg l-1 of thiamine; 3 ml of trace element solution (g l-1 20.0, Na-EDTA; 15.0, FeCl3·6H2O; 0.5, CaCl2·2H2O; 0.2, ZnSO4·7H2O; 0.2, CoCl2·6H2O; 0.2, CuSO4·5H2O; 0.2, MnSO4·4H2O). The chemostat culture was performed with adding feed medium

    <Data-Processing>
Expression data were analyzed with the Microarray Analysis Suite, version 5.0  (Affymetrix). Global scaling was performed to compare genes between chips. Each chip was normalized to a target intensity value of 2,500. Expression analysis files created by Microarray Suite, version 5.0, were exported to Microsoft Excel for data formatting.

E. coli samples for RNA extraction were taken during fermentation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at the cultivation temperature (37°C, 10,000 g, 1 min), separated from the supernatant, and rapidly frozen in dry ice. The samples were stored at -70°C until analysis
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were carried out in a 5 l fermentor BIOSTAT B-DCU (Sartorius BBI Systems Inc. Melsungen) at controlled temperature 37°C, pH 7.0, and dissolved oxygen tension 30%. The culture volume was 2 l. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. The synthetic culture medium had the following composition (g l-1): 8, glucose; 14.6, K2HPO4; 3.6, NaH2PO4·H2O; 2.68, (NH4)2SO4; 2, Na2SO4; 1, MgSO4; 1, Na-citrate; 0.5, NH4Cl; 2 ml of 10 mg l-1 of thiamine; 3 ml of trace element solution (g l-1 20.0, Na-EDTA; 15.0, FeCl3·6H2O; 0.5, CaCl2·2H2O; 0.2, ZnSO4·7H2O; 0.2, CoCl2·6H2O; 0.2, CuSO4·5H2O; 0.2, MnSO4·4H2O).

    <Data-Processing>
Expression data were analyzed with the Microarray Analysis Suite, version 5.0  (Affymetrix). Global scaling was performed to compare genes between chips. Each chip was normalized to a target intensity value of 2,500. Expression analysis files created by Microarray Suite, version 5.0, were exported to Microsoft Excel for data formatting.

All cultures were carried out in a 5 l fermentor BIOSTAT B-DCU (Sartorius BBI Systems Inc. Melsungen) at controlled temperature 37°C, pH 7.0, and dissolved oxygen tension 30%. The culture volume was 2 l. All reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. The synthetic culture medium had the following composition (g l-1): 8, glucose; 14.6, K2HPO4; 3.6, NaH2PO4·H2O; 2.68, (NH4)2SO4; 2, Na2SO4; 1, MgSO4; 1, Na-citrate; 0.5, NH4Cl; 2 ml of 10 mg l-1 of thiamine; 3 ml of trace element solution (g l-1 20.0, Na-EDTA; 15.0, FeCl3·6H2O; 0.5, CaCl2·2H2O; 0.2, ZnSO4·7H2O; 0.2, CoCl2·6H2O; 0.2, CuSO4·5H2O; 0.2, MnSO4·4H2O).

E. coli samples for RNA extraction were taken during fermentation. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at the cultivation temperature (37°C, 10,000 g, 1 min), separated from the supernatant, and rapidly frozen in dry ice. The samples were stored at -70°C until analysis

    <Summary>
Transcription profiles in BL21, BL21/pOri1 and BL21/pOri2 were analysed using DNA microarray technology. BL21, BL21/pOri1 or BL21/pOri2 strains were cultured at chemostat status and harvested after the cultivation arrived steady status.
Keywords: Effects of plasmid DNA on Escherichia coli metabolism
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
BL21, BL21/pOri1 and BL21/pOri2 were cultured at the exponential growth status or at the same growth rate status, respectively. E. coli BL21, BL21/pOri1 and BL21/pOri2 RNAs were reverse-transcripted into cDNAs, The RNAs from the BL21, BL21/pOri1, BL21/pOri2 were labelled with biotin. The labelled cDNAs were mixed and then hybridized on the microarray slides. Experiments were repeated four times. Most of them have no significant difference comparing plasmid-carrying E. coli and plasmid-free E. coli
