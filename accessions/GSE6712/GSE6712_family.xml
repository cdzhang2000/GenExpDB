    <Description>
The Panorama Escherichia coli Gene Array was developed using E. coli ORFmers (PCR primers). The PCR primers were developed as part of a collaboration with the E. coli Genome Group, headed by Dr. Fred Blattner at the Department of Genetics, University of Wisconsin-Madison (http://www.genome.wisc.edu).  The array contains 4,290 PCR-amplified ORFs, representing all of the protein-encoding genes.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Frozen cultures were inoculated in 5 ml TSB and incubated over-night. One ml culture was inoculated in 99 ml TSB in 500 ml baffled shake flask and incubated at 37 oC with shaking. Bacterial cells were harvested at mid log phase (~108 CFU ml-1).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Bacterial cells were harvested directly from shake flask into RNAprotect (Qiagen) to secure stable RNA before cell lysis. One volume of culture (1x108 CFU ml-1) was added to two volumes of RNA protect, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the supernatant removed.Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech). The ratio between the measured absorbance at the two wavelengths shows an estimate of RNA purity with respect to contamination. (Qiagen Bench guide). RNA degradation was checked with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer according to userguide from Agilent Technologies. Before cDNA labelling, variations in RNA concentrations were adjusted to 1 µg µl-1 for all array hybridizations.

      <Label-Protocol>
Labeled cDNA was prepared according to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene array protocol (Sigma Genosys), with some modifications. SuperscriptTM II Rnase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Sheared Salmon Sperm DNA (Ambidon) replaced equivalent components given in the Panorama protocol. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed with MicroSpinTM G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to given protocol.
      </Label-Protocol>
    </Channel>
    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Purified labeled cDNA were hybridised to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene array, according to supplied protocol. [33P] dCTP from Amersham Bioscience was used for all hybridisations.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
The membranes were wrapped in clear plastic film and exposed to a Storage Phosphore Screen (Amersham Biosciences) for 6-7 days. After exposure the screens were scanned with Thyphoon 8600 variable mode imager (Amersham Biosciences).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
The arrays were stripped between hybridisations according to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene arrays technical protocol (Sigma Genosys).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The software Imagene (BioDiscovery) was used for quantification of data and the software Genespring (Silicon Genetics) for normalisation. Pixel density for each spot was determined by laying down a grid of individual circles corresponding to each spot and the grid template for E. coli K-12 (Sigma genosys) was loaded for gene identification of each spot. No genes were flagged or no cut-off were made before normalisation in GeneSpring. The data was normalised by subtracting background based on all empty spots (negative controls) on the array. In addition each array was normalised to 50th percentile to adjust signal intensity of each array to all arrays. Each array was defined as independent samples in further data analysis.

Bacterial cells were harvested directly from shake flask into RNAprotect (Qiagen) to secure stable RNA before cell lysis. One volume of culture (1x108 CFU ml-1) was added to two volumes of RNA protect, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the supernatant removed.Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech). The ratio between the measured absorbance at the two wavelengths shows an estimate of RNA purity with respect to contamination. (Qiagen Bench guide). RNA degradation was checked with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer according to userguide from Agilent Technologies. Before cDNA labelling, variations in RNA concentrations were adjusted to 1 µg µl-1 for all array hybridizations.

    <Data-Processing>
The software Imagene (BioDiscovery) was used for quantification of data and the software Genespring (Silicon Genetics) for normalisation. Pixel density for each spot was determined by laying down a grid of individual circles corresponding to each spot and the grid template for E. coli K-12 (Sigma genosys) was loaded for gene identification of each spot. No genes were flagged or no cut-off were made before normalisation in GeneSpring. The data was normalised by subtracting background based on all empty spots (negative controls) on the array. In addition each array was normalised to 50th percentile to adjust signal intensity of each array to all arrays. Each array was defined as independent samples in further data analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Frozen cultures were inoculated in 5 ml TSB and incubated over-night. Two drops culture was inoculated in 5 ml TSB with benzalkonium chloride (BC) in a range of concentrations in 2 µg ml-1 steps. The cultures were incubated over night (20-24 h) and inspected visually for growth. The tube with highest BC concentration with visible growth was reinoculated (two drops) in tubes with fresh TSB, with a range of BC-concentrations in steps of 2 µg ml-1. The cultures were incubated over-night and inspected visually for growth. This procedure was continued in a total of 30-40 days until five reinoculations did not result in growth at higher concentrations of BC.

      <Growth-Protocol>
Frozen cultures were inoculated in 5 ml TSB and incubated over-night. One ml culture was inoculated in 99 ml TSB in 500 ml baffled shake flask and incubated at 37 oC with shaking. Bacterial cells were harvested at mid log phase (~108 CFU ml-1).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Bacterial cells were harvested directly from shake flask into RNAprotect (Qiagen) to secure stable RNA before cell lysis. One volume of culture (1x108 CFU ml-1) was added to two volumes of RNA protect, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the supernatant removed.Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech). The ratio between the measured absorbance at the two wavelengths shows an estimate of RNA purity with respect to contamination. (Qiagen Bench guide). RNA degradation was checked with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer according to userguide from Agilent Technologies. Before cDNA labelling, variations in RNA concentrations were adjusted to 1 µg µl-1 for all array hybridizations.

Labeled cDNA was prepared according to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene array protocol (Sigma Genosys), with some modifications. SuperscriptTM II Rnase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Sheared Salmon Sperm DNA (Ambidon) replaced equivalent components given in the Panorama protocol.

The arrays were stripped between hybridisations according to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene arrays technical protocol (Sigma Genosys).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The software Imagene (BioDiscovery) was used for quantification of data and the software Genespring (Silicon Genetics) for normalisation. Pixel density for each spot was determined by laying down a grid of individual circles corresponding to each spot and the grid template for E. coli K-12 (Sigma genosys) was loaded for gene identification of each spot. No genes were flagged or no cut-off were made before normalisation in GeneSpring. The data was normalised by subtracting background based on all empty spots (negative controls) on the array. In addition each array was normalised to 50th percentile to adjust signal intensity of each array to all arrays. Each array was defined as independent samples in further data analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Frozen cultures were inoculated in 5 ml TSB and incubated over-night. Two drops culture was inoculated in 5 ml TSB with benzalkonium chloride (BC) in a range of concentrations in 2 µg ml-1 steps. The cultures were incubated over night (20-24 h) and inspected visually for growth. The tube with highest BC concentration with visible growth was reinoculated (two drops) in tubes with fresh TSB, with a range of BC-concentrations in steps of 2 µg ml-1. The cultures were incubated over-night and inspected visually for growth. This procedure was continued in a total of 30-40 days until five reinoculations did not result in growth at higher concentrations of BC.  
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Frozen cultures were inoculated in 5 ml TSB and incubated over-night. One ml culture was inoculated in 99 ml TSB with 50 µg ml-1 benzalkonium chloride in 500 ml baffled shake flask and incubated at 37 oC with shaking. Bacterial cells were harvested at mid log phase (~108 CFU ml-1).

      <Extract-Protocol>
Bacterial cells were harvested directly from shake flask into RNAprotect (Qiagen) to secure stable RNA before cell lysis. One volume of culture (1x108 CFU ml-1) was added to two volumes of RNA protect, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the supernatant removed.Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech). The ratio between the measured absorbance at the two wavelengths shows an estimate of RNA purity with respect to contamination. (Qiagen Bench guide). RNA degradation was checked with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer according to userguide from Agilent Technologies. Before cDNA labelling, variations in RNA concentrations were adjusted to 1 µg µl-1 for all array hybridizations.

Labeled cDNA was prepared according to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene array protocol (Sigma Genosys), with some modifications. SuperscriptTM II Rnase H- Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and Sheared Salmon Sperm DNA (Ambidon) replaced equivalent components given in the Panorama protocol. The unincorporated nucleotides were removed with MicroSpinTM G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to given protocol.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Purified labeled cDNA were hybridised to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene array, according to supplied protocol. [33P] dCTP from Amersham Bioscience was used for all hybridisations.

The arrays were stripped between hybridisations according to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene arrays technical protocol (Sigma Genosys).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The software Imagene (BioDiscovery) was used for quantification of data and the software Genespring (Silicon Genetics) for normalisation. Pixel density for each spot was determined by laying down a grid of individual circles corresponding to each spot and the grid template for E. coli K-12 (Sigma genosys) was loaded for gene identification of each spot. No genes were flagged or no cut-off were made before normalisation in GeneSpring. The data was normalised by subtracting background based on all empty spots (negative controls) on the array. In addition each array was normalised to 50th percentile to adjust signal intensity of each array to all arrays. Each array was defined as independent samples in further data analysis.

The arrays were stripped between hybridisations according to the PanoramaTM E. coli gene arrays technical protocol (Sigma Genosys).
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The software Imagene (BioDiscovery) was used for quantification of data and the software Genespring (Silicon Genetics) for normalisation. Pixel density for each spot was determined by laying down a grid of individual circles corresponding to each spot and the grid template for E. coli K-12 (Sigma genosys) was loaded for gene identification of each spot. No genes were flagged or no cut-off were made before normalisation in GeneSpring. The data was normalised by subtracting background based on all empty spots (negative controls) on the array. In addition each array was normalised to 50th percentile to adjust signal intensity of each array to all arrays. Each array was defined as independent samples in further data analysis.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Frozen cultures were inoculated in 5 ml TSB and incubated over-night. Two drops culture was inoculated in 5 ml TSB with benzalkonium chloride (BC) in a range of concentrations in 2 µg ml-1 steps. The cultures were incubated over night (20-24 h) and inspected visually for growth. The tube with highest BC concentration with visible growth was reinoculated (two drops) in tubes with fresh TSB, with a range of BC-concentrations in steps of 2 µg ml-1. The cultures were incubated over-night and inspected visually for growth. This procedure was continued in a total of 30-40 days until five reinoculations did not result in growth at higher concentrations of BC.

Bacterial cells were harvested directly from shake flask into RNAprotect (Qiagen) to secure stable RNA before cell lysis. One volume of culture (1x108 CFU ml-1) was added to two volumes of RNA protect, vortexed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. The sample was then centrifuged at 5000 g for 10 min and the supernatant removed.Total RNA was isolated using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. The concentration of RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm in an Ultrospec 3000 spectrophotometer (Pharmacia Biotech). The ratio between the measured absorbance at the two wavelengths shows an estimate of RNA purity with respect to contamination. (Qiagen Bench guide). RNA degradation was checked with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer according to userguide from Agilent Technologies. Before cDNA labelling, variations in RNA concentrations were adjusted to 1 µg µl-1 for all array hybridizations.

    <Title>Adapted tolerance to Benzalkonium chloride in E. coli K12</Title>

    <Pubmed-ID>17379704</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Benzalkonium chloride (BC) is a commonly used disinfectant and preservative. This study describes changes in expression level on the transcriptomic and proteomic level for Escherichia coli K12 gradually adapted to a tolerance level towards BC of 7-8 times the initial MIC. Results from DNA arrays and two-dimensional (2-DE) gel electrophoresis for global gene and protein expression studies were confirmed by real time quantitative PCR. Peptide mass fingerprinting by MALDI-TOF MS was used to identify differentially expressed proteins. Changes in expression level in adapted cells were shown for porins, drug transporters, glycolytic enzymes, ribosomal subunits and several genes and proteins involved in protection against oxidative stress and antibiotics. Adapted strains showed increased tolerance to several antibiotics.  In conclusion, E. coli K12 adapted to higher tolerance to BC, acquired several general resistance mechanisms including responses normally related to the multiple antibiotic resistance (Mar) regulon and protection against oxidative stress. The results revealed that BC treatment might result in superoxide stress in E. coli.
Keywords: Study of resistance mechanism
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
E. coli K12 was adapted to grow in the presence of benzalkonium chloride in three independen experiments resulting in three adapted strains (BCadapted1, BCadapted2 and BCadapted3). Control strains were cultivated in TSB before harvesting and adapted strains were cultivated either in TSB with or without 50 ppm benzalkonium chloride before harvesting. Cultures for transcriptional analysis were harvested three times at different days resulting in three replicate experiments. Samples from the fist day is termed replicate1, day 2 is termed replicate2 and day three replicate3. For the controls, samples from two cultures were sampled for replicate one and two.
