RNA was extracted from control samples using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In each case, 5 ml samples were mixed with bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen) to stabilise the transcripts, and the cells were recovered by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen), mechanically broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine CA) at a speed setting of 6.0 for 40 seconds, and their lysate RNA was extracted from the cell lysate as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified and residual DNA fragments were removed by DNAase (Qiagen) treatment using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA was synthesized from the purified RNA by the Institute of Genomics Research microarray protocol (TIGR). In this process 2 μg of the purified RNA was annealed with random hexamers as primers (Invitrogen) (70°C/5min and snap frozen in ice/1min), and extended overnight at 42°C with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM DNTP/aa-UTP (Ambion) mix. Residual RNA was removed and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then recovered, labeld with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and purified, using Qiagen PCR purification kits following the manufacturers instructions.

Purified labeled L. monocytogenes cDNA from test and control samples were hybridised on L. monocytogenes version 2 oligonucleotide microarray representing Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from L. monocytogenes strains EGD-e, 4b F2365, 1/2a F6854 and 4b H7858, obtained from Pathogen Functional Genomic Research Centre (http://pfgrc.tigr.org). Before hybridization, microarray slides were pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer at 42˚C for 45 min. Pre-hybridized slides were washed with water (4 times) and isopropanol (3 times) for 2 min each and dried by centrifugation. Purified probes were speed-vaced and resuspended in hybridization buffer. The probes in hybridization buffer were applied to the microarray slides covered with lifterslips (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridized slides were sealed in a water tight hybridization chamber. These chambers were incubated for 14-16 h in a 42˚C water bath. Hybridized arrays were then washed 2 times with low stringency, medium stringency, and high stringency buffers for 10 min at room temperature using a reciprocal shaking table.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Hybridised slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were stored as single TIFF images.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Several controls were employed to minimise technical and biological variations, and ensure the quality of the data: i) each ORF was present quadruplicate in each array, ii) each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two-separate arrays with reversal of incorporated dye.
For all supplementary raw data files - Channel A = Cy3; Channel B= Cy5.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
TIFF images of the hybridised arrays were analysed using the TIGR spotfinder software (www.tigr.org/software), and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalised using the LOWESS algorithm by the TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/control signal for each spot was recorded. The averaged log2 ratio for each gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (Significance-Analysis-of-Microarrays:
http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/) software using one class mode.

RNA was extracted from control samples using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In each case, 5 ml samples were mixed with bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen) to stabilise the transcripts, and the cells were recovered by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen), mechanically broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine CA) at a speed setting of 6.0 for 40 seconds, and their lysate RNA was extracted from the cell lysate as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified and residual DNA fragments were removed by DNAase (Qiagen) treatment using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

cDNA was synthesized from the purified RNA by the Institute of Genomics Research microarray protocol (TIGR). In this process 2 μg of the purified RNA was annealed with random hexamers as primers (Invitrogen) (70°C/5min and snap frozen in ice/1min), and extended overnight at 42°C with SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 0.1 M dithiothreitol 12.5 mM DNTP/aa-UTP (Ambion) mix. Residual RNA was removed and cDNA was purified with a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen). Purified aminoallyl-modified cDNA was then recovered, labeld with Cy3 or Cy5 mono-functional NHS ester cyanogen dyes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ), and purified, using Qiagen PCR purification kits following the manufacturers instructions.

Purified labeled L. monocytogenes cDNA from test and control samples were hybridised on L. monocytogenes version 2 oligonucleotide microarray representing Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from L. monocytogenes strains EGD-e, 4b F2365, 1/2a F6854 and 4b H7858, obtained from Pathogen Functional Genomic Research Centre (http://pfgrc.tigr.org). Before hybridization, microarray slides were pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer at 42˚C for 45 min. Pre-hybridized slides were washed with water (4 times) and isopropanol (3 times) for 2 min each and dried by centrifugation. Purified probes were speed-vaced and resuspended in hybridization buffer. The probes in hybridization buffer were applied to the microarray slides covered with lifterslips (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridized slides were sealed in a water tight hybridization chamber. These chambers were incubated for 14-16 h in a 42˚C water bath. Hybridized arrays were then washed 2 times with low stringency, medium stringency, and high stringency buffers for 10 min at room temperature using a reciprocal shaking table.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
Hybridised slides were scanned using a GenePix 4000B microarray scanner (Axon Instruments) with Acuity 4.0 software and scans were stored as single TIFF images.
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Description>
Several controls were employed to minimise technical and biological variations, and ensure the quality of the data: i) each ORF was present quadruplicate in each array, ii) each RNA preparation was used to make probes for at least two-separate arrays with reversal of incorporated dye.
For all supplementary raw data files - Channel A = Cy3; Channel B= Cy5.
    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
TIFF images of the hybridised arrays were analysed using the TIGR spotfinder software (www.tigr.org/software), and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalised using the LOWESS algorithm by the TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/control signal for each spot was recorded. The averaged log2 ratio for each gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (Significance-Analysis-of-Microarrays:
http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/) software using one class mode.

    <Data-Processing>
TIFF images of the hybridised arrays were analysed using the TIGR spotfinder software (www.tigr.org/software), and the local background was subsequently subtracted. The data set was normalised using the LOWESS algorithm by the TIGR-MIDAS (www.tigr.org/software) software. The normalized log2 ratio of test/control signal for each spot was recorded. The averaged log2 ratio for each gene on the six replicate slides was ultimately calculated. Significant changes of gene expression were identified with SAM (Significance-Analysis-of-Microarrays:
http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/SAM/) software using one class mode.

RNA was extracted from control samples using the Qiagen RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). In each case, 5 ml samples were mixed with bacterial RNA protect solution (Qiagen) to stabilise the transcripts, and the cells were recovered by centrifugation. Pelleted cells were resuspended in 1 ml of Trizol (Invitrogen), mechanically broken using the FastPrep system (Qbiogene, Irvine CA) at a speed setting of 6.0 for 40 seconds, and their lysate RNA was extracted from the cell lysate as per the manufacturer’s instructions. Extracted RNA was purified and residual DNA fragments were removed by DNAase (Qiagen) treatment using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Purified labeled L. monocytogenes cDNA from test and control samples were hybridised on L. monocytogenes version 2 oligonucleotide microarray representing Open Reading Frames (ORFs) from L. monocytogenes strains EGD-e, 4b F2365, 1/2a F6854 and 4b H7858, obtained from Pathogen Functional Genomic Research Centre (http://pfgrc.tigr.org). Before hybridization, microarray slides were pre-hybridized with pre-hybridization buffer at 42˚C for 45 min. Pre-hybridized slides were washed with water (4 times) and isopropanol (3 times) for 2 min each and dried by centrifugation. Purified probes were speed-vaced and resuspended in hybridization buffer. The probes in hybridization buffer were applied to the microarray slides covered with lifterslips (Erie Scientific Co.). Hybridized slides were sealed in a water tight hybridization chamber. These chambers were incubated for 14-16 h in a 42˚C water bath. Hybridized arrays were then washed 2 times with low stringency, medium stringency, and high stringency buffers for 10 min at room temperature using a reciprocal shaking table.

    <Title>TRANSCRIPTIONAL PROFILING OF FUR– AND IRON- REGULATED GENE EXPRESSION IN LISTERIA MONOCYTOGENES</Title>

    <Summary>
Iron is required by almost all bacteria but concentrations of iron above the physiological levels are toxic. In bacteria, intracellular iron is regulated mostly by ferric uptake regulator, Fur or a similar functional protein. Iron limitation results in regulation of number of genes, including those involved in iron uptake process. A subset of the genes under the control of Fur is called Fur regulon. In this study we have identified the Fur- and iron- regulated genes in Listeria monocytogenes by DNA microarray analysis using fur mutant and its isogenic parent. In order to identify genes exclusively regulated in response to iron limitation, fur mutant and its isogenic parent grown in iron-deficient KRM media were compared. Similarly, to identify Fur regulated genes, fur mutant was compared with the parent under iron-deficient and excess-iron conditions. Listeria in low-iron resulted in up-regulation of 180 and down-regulation of 200 genes whereas in the fur mutant, 79 genes were up-regulated and 49 genes down-regulated.  Our studies have identified at least 12 genes that are negatively controlled by Fur. In iron-deficient condition, these genes were up-regulated, while expression of fur was down-regulated. To further investigate the fur regulation, the fur promoter-lacZ transcriptional fusion strains were constructed in fur and perR mutant background. In the  perR mutant, the regulation of fur, svpA, and feoB was inhibited in the iron-limited conditions. Our results indicate that fur is negatively regulated by Fur and PerR. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that regulation of some of the genes in iron-limited conditions require PerR. 

    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Experiments were aimed to determine significant transcriptional changes of (a) EGDe strain in the absence of iron (b) fur mutant compared to EGDe in the absence of iron (c) fur mutant compared to EGDe in the presence of iron and (d) fur mutant in the absence of iron. In each transcriptional profiling experiment, labeled cDNA prepared from total RNA was hybridized to L. monocytogenes array slides. The data from the hybridizations for each of the above experiments were  normalized using MIDAS software using LOWESS algorithm to minimize biological and experimental variations. Significantly expressed or repressed genes were identified by estimating the false discovery rate (FDR) using significance analysis of microarrays (SAM) (Δ = 1.01; False discovery rate (FDR) at 5%; q &lt; 0.05).
