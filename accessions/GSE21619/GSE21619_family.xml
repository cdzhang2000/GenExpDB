      <Growth-Protocol>
Overnight cultures of JFP41 grown in Todd Hewitt (TH) broth (Bacto, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) horse serum (TH-HS) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) at 37ºC were diluted 1:200 in pre-warmed TH-HS (7.6). The culture was allowed to incubate until the optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

Slides were pretreated for 2 – 3 h at 42ºC in 50µl of prehybridization solution (5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA). Slides were maintained in hybridization cassettes (ArrayIt®, Sunnyvale, CA) throughout the incubation phase. The slides were then washed three times with MilliQ water in a High Throughput Wash Station (ArrayIt®) followed with one wash in isopropanol and dried using a mini-slide centrifuge (Labnet International, Edison, NJ). Dried probes were then resuspended in 50µl hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6µg/µl salmon sperm DNA). The solution was heated at 95ºC for 10 min while vortexing intermittently and then transferred onto pretreated slides under a LifterSlip™ (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). The probes were allowed to hybridize for 16 – 20 h at 42ºC in a hybridization cassette. Humidity was maintained with the addition of 15µl of unused hybridization buffer in each well. Slides were washed twice in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT at 55ºC for 10 min, twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min, and twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in MilliQ water before being dried in a mini-slide centrifuge. Microarrays were immediately scanned in an Axon GenePix® 4200 scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies).

    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 3. Uninduced JFP41 cells. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

Slides were pretreated for 2 – 3 h at 42ºC in 50µl of prehybridization solution (5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA). Slides were maintained in hybridization cassettes (ArrayIt®, Sunnyvale, CA) throughout the incubation phase. The slides were then washed three times with MilliQ water in a High Throughput Wash Station (ArrayIt®) followed with one wash in isopropanol and dried using a mini-slide centrifuge (Labnet International, Edison, NJ). Dried probes were then resuspended in 50µl hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6µg/µl salmon sperm DNA). The solution was heated at 95ºC for 10 min while vortexing intermittently and then transferred onto pretreated slides under a LifterSlip™ (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). The probes were allowed to hybridize for 16 – 20 h at 42ºC in a hybridization cassette. Humidity was maintained with the addition of 15µl of unused hybridization buffer in each well. Slides were washed twice in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT at 55ºC for 10 min, twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min, and twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in MilliQ water before being dried in a mini-slide centrifuge. Microarrays were immediately scanned in an Axon GenePix® 4200 scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies).

    <Description>
Biological replicate 3 of 3. Uninduced JFP41 cells. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

Slides were pretreated for 2 – 3 h at 42ºC in 50µl of prehybridization solution (5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA). Slides were maintained in hybridization cassettes (ArrayIt®, Sunnyvale, CA) throughout the incubation phase. The slides were then washed three times with MilliQ water in a High Throughput Wash Station (ArrayIt®) followed with one wash in isopropanol and dried using a mini-slide centrifuge (Labnet International, Edison, NJ). Dried probes were then resuspended in 50µl hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6µg/µl salmon sperm DNA). The solution was heated at 95ºC for 10 min while vortexing intermittently and then transferred onto pretreated slides under a LifterSlip™ (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). The probes were allowed to hybridize for 16 – 20 h at 42ºC in a hybridization cassette. Humidity was maintained with the addition of 15µl of unused hybridization buffer in each well. Slides were washed twice in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT at 55ºC for 10 min, twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min, and twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in MilliQ water before being dried in a mini-slide centrifuge. Microarrays were immediately scanned in an Axon GenePix® 4200 scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies).

Biological replicate 2 of 3. Induced cells 2.5 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 2 of 3. Induced cells 5 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Biological replicate 1 of 3. Induced cells 7.5 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Once an optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07, cells were treated with Streptococcus sanguinis synthetic CSP (NH2-DLRGVPNPWGWIFGR-COOH) at a concentration of 220 ng/ml and incubated for the appropriate time.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Overnight cultures of JFP41 grown in Todd Hewitt (TH) broth (Bacto, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) horse serum (TH-HS) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) at 37ºC were diluted 1:200 in pre-warmed TH-HS (7.6). The culture was allowed to incubate until the optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

Biological replicate 1 of 3. Induced cells 10 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once an optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07, cells were treated with Streptococcus sanguinis synthetic CSP (NH2-DLRGVPNPWGWIFGR-COOH) at a concentration of 220 ng/ml and incubated for the appropriate time.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Overnight cultures of JFP41 grown in Todd Hewitt (TH) broth (Bacto, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) horse serum (TH-HS) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) at 37ºC were diluted 1:200 in pre-warmed TH-HS (7.6). The culture was allowed to incubate until the optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

Slides were pretreated for 2 – 3 h at 42ºC in 50µl of prehybridization solution (5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA). Slides were maintained in hybridization cassettes (ArrayIt®, Sunnyvale, CA) throughout the incubation phase. The slides were then washed three times with MilliQ water in a High Throughput Wash Station (ArrayIt®) followed with one wash in isopropanol and dried using a mini-slide centrifuge (Labnet International, Edison, NJ). Dried probes were then resuspended in 50µl hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6µg/µl salmon sperm DNA). The solution was heated at 95ºC for 10 min while vortexing intermittently and then transferred onto pretreated slides under a LifterSlip™ (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). The probes were allowed to hybridize for 16 – 20 h at 42ºC in a hybridization cassette. Humidity was maintained with the addition of 15µl of unused hybridization buffer in each well. Slides were washed twice in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT at 55ºC for 10 min, twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min, and twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in MilliQ water before being dried in a mini-slide centrifuge. Microarrays were immediately scanned in an Axon GenePix® 4200 scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies).

    <Description>
Biological replicate 1 of 3. Induced cells 12.5 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

Slides were pretreated for 2 – 3 h at 42ºC in 50µl of prehybridization solution (5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA). Slides were maintained in hybridization cassettes (ArrayIt®, Sunnyvale, CA) throughout the incubation phase. The slides were then washed three times with MilliQ water in a High Throughput Wash Station (ArrayIt®) followed with one wash in isopropanol and dried using a mini-slide centrifuge (Labnet International, Edison, NJ). Dried probes were then resuspended in 50µl hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6µg/µl salmon sperm DNA). The solution was heated at 95ºC for 10 min while vortexing intermittently and then transferred onto pretreated slides under a LifterSlip™ (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). The probes were allowed to hybridize for 16 – 20 h at 42ºC in a hybridization cassette. Humidity was maintained with the addition of 15µl of unused hybridization buffer in each well. Slides were washed twice in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT at 55ºC for 10 min, twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min, and twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in MilliQ water before being dried in a mini-slide centrifuge. Microarrays were immediately scanned in an Axon GenePix® 4200 scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies).

    <Description>
Biological replicate 3 of 3. Induced cells 12.5 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

    <Description>
Biological replicate 3 of 3. Induced cells 15 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Biological replicate 2 of 2. Induced cells 17.5 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

Once an optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07, cells were treated with Streptococcus sanguinis synthetic CSP (NH2-DLRGVPNPWGWIFGR-COOH) at a concentration of 220 ng/ml and incubated for the appropriate time.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Overnight cultures of JFP41 grown in Todd Hewitt (TH) broth (Bacto, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) horse serum (TH-HS) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) at 37ºC were diluted 1:200 in pre-warmed TH-HS (7.6). The culture was allowed to incubate until the optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

Biological replicate 3 of 3. Induced cells 20 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Once an optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07, cells were treated with Streptococcus sanguinis synthetic CSP (NH2-DLRGVPNPWGWIFGR-COOH) at a concentration of 220 ng/ml and incubated for the appropriate time.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
Overnight cultures of JFP41 grown in Todd Hewitt (TH) broth (Bacto, Sparks, MD) supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) horse serum (TH-HS) (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) at 37ºC were diluted 1:200 in pre-warmed TH-HS (7.6). The culture was allowed to incubate until the optical density at 660 nm reached ~0.07.

Twenty ml of culture was removed and mixed with an equal volume of hot acid phenol containing 0.1 M citrate buffer (pH 4.3, Sigma) and 0.1% (v/v) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS, Ambion, Austin, TX). Samples were incubated in a boiling water bath for 10 min, cooled in an ice bath and transferred to Phase Lock Gel™ (PLG) tubes (5 Prime Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). After centrifugation at 1500 x g for 5 min, the supernatant was removed and extracted with an equal volume of acid phenol:chloroform  (1:1), then chloroform. RNA was precipitated from the supernatant by NaOAc/isopropanol precipitation, followed by centrifugation. The resulting RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dried via tube inversion, and dissolved in 100µl DEPC-treated water. Samples were then treated with DNase I and purified over RNeasy columns (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to protocols supplied by the manufacturer.

2µg total RNA was annealed to 6µg random hexamers (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in a total volume of 18.5µl and incubated at 70ºC for 10 min. Samples were snap frozen in ethanol at -80ºC for 30s before addition of 6µl of 5x First Strand Buffer (250 mM Tris-Cl, pH 8.3, 375 mM KCl, 15 mM MgCl2), 3µl 0.1M DTT, and 0.6µl of dNTP solution (25 mM each dATP, dCTP, and dGTP, 15 mM dTTP (Invitrogen) and 10 mM amino allyl-dUTP (Sigma)). The solution was then incubated overnight at 42ºC with 300 U of Superscript III (Invitrogen). The RNA template was then hydrolyzed via the addition of 10µl 0.5 M EDTA and 10µl 1 M NaOH and incubation at 65ºC for 15 min. The mixture was neutralized with 25µl 1 M Tris pH 7.0 and 10µl 3 M NaOAc, and purified using MiniElute® PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) replacing the Tris buffers with phosphate buffers (5 mM KPO4, pH 8, 80% EtOH) and (4 mM KPO4, pH 8.5) for the wash and elution steps, respectively. The reaction was then dried in a Speed-Vac centrifuge before being resuspended in 4.5µl 0.1 M Na2HCO3, pH 9.3 and 4.5µl of the ester dye (Cy3 or Cy5 (Amersham) for the control and experimental samples, respectively). The coupling reaction proceeded for 1.5 - 2 h at room temperature in the dark before being stopped via the addition of 35µl 100 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and then purified over Qiagen MiniElute PCR purification columns per the manufacturer's protocol and supplied buffers.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Slides were pretreated for 2 – 3 h at 42ºC in 50µl of prehybridization solution (5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA). Slides were maintained in hybridization cassettes (ArrayIt®, Sunnyvale, CA) throughout the incubation phase. The slides were then washed three times with MilliQ water in a High Throughput Wash Station (ArrayIt®) followed with one wash in isopropanol and dried using a mini-slide centrifuge (Labnet International, Edison, NJ). Dried probes were then resuspended in 50µl hybridization buffer (40% formamide, 5x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.6µg/µl salmon sperm DNA). The solution was heated at 95ºC for 10 min while vortexing intermittently and then transferred onto pretreated slides under a LifterSlip™ (Erie Scientific, Portsmouth, NH). The probes were allowed to hybridize for 16 – 20 h at 42ºC in a hybridization cassette. Humidity was maintained with the addition of 15µl of unused hybridization buffer in each well. Slides were washed twice in 2x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT at 55ºC for 10 min, twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1% SDS, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min, and twice at room temperature in 0.1x SSC, 0.1 mM DTT for 5 min. The slides were then dipped in MilliQ water before being dried in a mini-slide centrifuge. Microarrays were immediately scanned in an Axon GenePix® 4200 scanner (MDS Analytical Technologies).

    <Description>
Biological replicate 3 of 3. Induced cells 30 min. after competence induction. An overlap extension PCR technique was used to fuse the start codon of the comC gene to the second codon of comD, thus deleting the comC gene and intervening sequence. The resulting mutant can not naturally create a competence stimulating peptide (CSP) and is thus unable to achieve competence without the addition of exogenous CSP.

    <Summary>
Streptococcus sanguinis is a major component of the oral flora and an important cause of infective endocarditis. The genome sequence of S. sanguinis strain SK36 was recently determined. A number of foreign genes acquired by natural transformation were detected, as well as orthologs of competence genes previously identified in other species. However, significant differences in the S. sanguinis competence system relative to that of other streptococci were noted. We sought to examine S. sanguinis genetic competence, to characterize the global transcriptional response to competence induction, and to compare our results with those obtained from previous analyses of other streptococci. A mutant possessing an in-frame deletion in the comC gene encoding the competence-stimulating peptide was created and confirmed to have the expected phenotype. Studies indicated that competence could be induced in this strain by addition of competence-stimulating peptide, and determined the optimal conditions to employ for this purpose. Expression was monitored by microarray analysis at multiple time points from 2.5 to 30 min after induction. Over 200 genes were identified whose expression was altered at least two-fold in at least one time point, with the majority upregulated. The “late” response was typical of that seen in previous studies. However, comparison of the “early” response in S. sanguinis with that of other streptococci revealed unexpected heterogeneity with regard to the number of genes induced, the nature of these genes, and their putative upstream regulatory sequences. S. sanguinis possesses a comparatively limited early response, which may define a minimal competence regulatory circuit.
