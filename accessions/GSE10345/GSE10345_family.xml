    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

    <Title>Genome-wide analysis of transcriptional termination in E. coli</Title>

    <Summary>
Transcription termination factor Rho is essential in enterobacteria. We inhibited Rho activity with bicyclomycin and used microarray experiments to assess Rho function on a genome-wide scale. Rho is a global regulator of gene expression that matches E. coli transcription to translational needs. Remarkably, genes that are most repressed by Rho are prophages and other horizontally-acquired portions of the genome. Elimination of these foreign DNA elements increases resistance to bicyclomycin. Although rho remains essential, such reduced-genome bacteria no longer require Rho cofactors NusA and NusG. Thus, Rho termination, supported by NusA and NusG, is required to suppress the toxic activity of foreign DNA.
Global regulation of transcription termination by Rho, NusA, and NusG.
Keywords: Antibiotic treatment
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Two sets of experiments are presented. First, treatment of E. coli with Rho inhibitor bicyclomycin was performed in strains MG1655 and O157:H7 EDL933 for twenty minutes at concentrations of 10, 25, or 100 micrograms/milliliter. In the second set of experiments the reduced-genome strain MDS42 was treated with bicyclomycin as well as having deletions of the genes nusA and nusG. Total RNA was extracted and hybridized to the Affymetrix E. coli Genome 2.0 array, which contains complete genome coverage of four strains of E. coli.
