      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

      <Extract-Protocol>
RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

    <Data-Processing>
For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (74104) and mechanical cell disruption with glass beads but without enzymatic lysis. This was carried out in the Qiagen RNeasy kit lysis RLT buffer with beta-mercaptethanol, according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Mechanical cell disruption was completed through shaking for five min using a Retsch mill (Retsch MM200) on maximum speed. RNA was subsequently cleaned on-column with an additional DNase treatment (Qiagen 79254). The quality of extracted RNA was determined with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer having used an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

For further analyses the processed signal intensities of all coding regions and RNA genes were extracted and used. Variance stabilization and normalization of the extracted intensities were performed with the vsn packages of the R software environment (R Development Core Team, 2007) and back-transformed to normal intensity scale. For each probeset, e.g. all probes representing for example, a single coding gene, outliers were removed by boxplot statistics and the outlier-removed probe intensities were averaged in a robust way by computing the Tukey biweight.

Oxidative stress 200 ug/ml of 30% pre-warmed hydrogen peroxide (Fluka) was added to 150 ml constantly stirred (330 rpm) cultures kept in 1000 ml flasks. Cold stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC into an ice cold water bath in order to lower the temperature, while stirring, to 16oC in less than 2 min, heat stress Cultures were transferred from 37oC to a 50oC water bath. While stirring, the temperature of each culture was raised to 45oC in less than 2 min. The constantly stirring (330rpm) cultures were then transferred to a 45oC water bath to maintain this temperature glucose lactose shift Carbon source concentrations of 0.15% lactose and 0.05% glucose were used (150 ml culture in 1000 ml flasks, 330 rpm stirring).

      <Growth-Protocol>
All cultures were grown aerobically in a thermostatically controlled 37oC culture room. Cultures (150ml culture volume) were stirred by magnetic stirrers at 330 rpm (Thermo Scientific Variomag Multipoint 6in) 1000ml Erlenmeyer flask. Starting cultures were inoculated from a single colony and grown overnight. Each experimental culture was then inoculated from such an overnight culture at a dilution of 1:20 into 150 ml fresh MOPS minimal medium in a 1000 ml flask. The minimal medium used for all experiments was a modification of MOPS (morpholinopropane sulfonate) minimal medium obtained from Teknova, CA (product number M2006) which contains 86 mM NaCl, 9.5 mM NH4Cl, 5 mM K2HPO4 and 0.2% glucose.

    <Title>Time resolved response of E. coli to 5 different stress conditions</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE20305</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>20461071</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
Environmental fluctuations lead to a rapid adjustment of the physiology of Escherichia coli, necessitating changes on every level of the underlying cellular and molecular network. Thus far, the vast majority of global analyses of E. coli stress responses have been limited to just one level, gene expression. Here we incorporate the metabolite composition together with gene expression data in order to provide a more comprehensive insight on system level stress adjustments by describing detailed time-resolved E. coli response to five different perturbations (cold, heat, oxidative stress, lactose diauxie, and stationary phase). The metabolite response is more specific as compared to the general response observed on the transcript level and is reflected by much higher specificity during the early stress adaptation phase and when comparing the stationary phase response to other perturbations. Despite these differences, the response on both levels still follows the same dynamics and general strategy of energy conservation as reflected by rapid decrease of central carbon metabolism intermediates coinciding with down regulation of genes related to cell growth. Application of co-clustering and canonical correlation analysis on combined metabolite and transcript data identified a number of significant condition dependent associations between metabolites and transcripts. The results confirm and extend existing models about co-regulation between gene expression and metabolites demonstrating the power of integrated systems oriented analysis.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Four different environmental perturbations, comprising oxidative stress, glucose-lactose diauxic shift, heat, and cold treatments and using an unperturbed culture as a control have been used for transcript profiling. microarray-based transcript profiling was carried out for samples from time points 10-50 min post-perturbation plus two control time points prior to each perturbation for all conditions except the oxidative stress experiment in which all samples (12 time points) were used for transcript profiling covering the entire growth curve, including the stationary phase. Each experimental condition was independently repeated three times.
