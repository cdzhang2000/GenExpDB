    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChip® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

E. coli RNA polymerase core enzyme was purchased from Epicentre (Madison, WI, USA). Histidine-tagged σ factors were produced and purified as described (Lacour et al., 2003; Checroun et al., 2004); proteins appeared pure from contaminants as determined by denaturing protein gel electrophoresis (data not shown). For reconstitution of RNA polymerase holoenzymes, the core enzyme was incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C with either σS or σ70 at a 1:10 ratio. For calculation of RNA polymerase concentrations in transcription assays, it was assumed that, after reconstitution, core enzyme would be 100% active and fully saturated by either σ factor. 2 ug of genomic DNA from E. coli MG1655 digested with EcoRI were used in transcription assays for ROMA experiments. RNA polymerase holoenzyme concentrations were 100 nM in 50 ul reaction mixture. Ten independent run-off transcription assays were performed, and transcripts were pooled together (ca. 1 ug total RNA).

      <Label-Protocol>
The RNA samples were processed for microarray hybridization, following the instructions of the GeneChip® Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Chapter 5,6 and 7, Prokaryotic target Preparation, Hybridization, Washing, Staining and Scanning). The protocol consists in cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription (starting in this case with 1 ug RNA), followed by cDNA fragmentation with DNase I and labeling with Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
The fragmented and labeled cDNAs were then hybridized for 16 h at 45°C on individual E.coli Genome 2.0 arrays.
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
After hybridization, GeneChips were washed and stained with streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin by using the Fluidic Station FS450 (Affymetrix) according to the FS450_0006 Protocol. Fluorescent images of the arrays were acquired using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
After quality controls of data distribution the raw data (CEL files) were used to perform, normalization and probe set summarization through RMA algorithm (Robust Multiarray Analysis) by using the Affymetrix Gene Expression Console Software (www.affymetrix.com).   Normalized data were then uploaded into OneChannelGUI Software (http://www.bioinformatica.unito.it/oneChannelGUI/)  to perform a differential expression analysis. As the dataset is limited in number of samples and replicates (4 GeneChips hybridized, 2 replicates for each condition) we decided to apply a  simple non-parametric statistical method based on ranks of fold changes to perform a two-class paired differential analysis. To select only significatively differentially expressed genes we set the following parameters for the Rank Product analysis: 100 permutations and 0.1 cut-off percentage of false positives (pfp) which corresponds to a p-value&lt;0.01.

      <Extract-Protocol>
E. coli RNA polymerase core enzyme was purchased from Epicentre (Madison, WI, USA). Histidine-tagged σ factors were produced and purified as described (Lacour et al., 2003; Checroun et al., 2004); proteins appeared pure from contaminants as determined by denaturing protein gel electrophoresis (data not shown). For reconstitution of RNA polymerase holoenzymes, the core enzyme was incubated for 10 minutes at 37 °C with either σS or σ70 at a 1:10 ratio. For calculation of RNA polymerase concentrations in transcription assays, it was assumed that, after reconstitution, core enzyme would be 100% active and fully saturated by either σ factor. 2 ug of genomic DNA from E. coli MG1655 digested with EcoRI were used in transcription assays for ROMA experiments. RNA polymerase holoenzyme concentrations were 100 nM in 50 ul reaction mixture. Ten independent run-off transcription assays were performed, and transcripts were pooled together (ca. 1 ug total RNA).

The RNA samples were processed for microarray hybridization, following the instructions of the GeneChip® Expression Analysis Technical Manual (Chapter 5,6 and 7, Prokaryotic target Preparation, Hybridization, Washing, Staining and Scanning). The protocol consists in cDNA synthesis by reverse transcription (starting in this case with 1 ug RNA), followed by cDNA fragmentation with DNase I and labeling with Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase.

The fragmented and labeled cDNAs were then hybridized for 16 h at 45°C on individual E.coli Genome 2.0 arrays.

    <Scan-Protocol>
After hybridization, GeneChips were washed and stained with streptavidin-conjugated phycoerythrin by using the Fluidic Station FS450 (Affymetrix) according to the FS450_0006 Protocol. Fluorescent images of the arrays were acquired using a GeneChip Scanner 3000 7G (Affymetrix).

    <Data-Processing>
After quality controls of data distribution the raw data (CEL files) were used to perform, normalization and probe set summarization through RMA algorithm (Robust Multiarray Analysis) by using the Affymetrix Gene Expression Console Software (www.affymetrix.com).   Normalized data were then uploaded into OneChannelGUI Software (http://www.bioinformatica.unito.it/oneChannelGUI/)  to perform a differential expression analysis. As the dataset is limited in number of samples and replicates (4 GeneChips hybridized, 2 replicates for each condition) we decided to apply a  simple non-parametric statistical method based on ranks of fold changes to perform a two-class paired differential analysis. To select only significatively differentially expressed genes we set the following parameters for the Rank Product analysis: 100 permutations and 0.1 cut-off percentage of false positives (pfp) which corresponds to a p-value&lt;0.01.

    <Summary>
Promoter recognition by bacterial RNA polymerase is mediated by σ subunits, which assemble transiently to RNA polymerase core enzyme (E) during transcription initiation. σ subunits drive transcription of specific sets of genes by allowing RNA polymerase to interact with different promoter sequences. However, σ70, the housekeeping σ subunit, and σS, an alternative σ subunit mainly active during slow growth and in response to cellular stresses, appear to recognize almost identical promoter sequences, raising the question of how promoter selectivity is achieved in the bacterial cell. To identifysequence determinants for selective promoter recognition, we performed a run-off/microarray experiment (ROMA): in vitro transcription experiments were carried out with RNA polymerase saturated either with σ70 (Eσ70) or with σS (EσS) using the whole Escherichia coli genome as DNA template, and transcript levels were determined by microarray analysis. We found that several genes associated with bacterial growth (e.g., ribosomal operons) were transcribed more efficiently by Eσ70. In contrast, EσS transcribed preferentially genes involved in stress responses, secondary metabolism, as well as regulatory RNAs and intergenic regions with yet unknown function. Genes preferentially recognized in vitro by EσS showed reduced expression in aσS-deficient mutant strain of E. coli. Sequence comparison of Eσ70- versus EσS –dependent promoters confirms that the presence of a -35 sequence and the relative location of UP elements affect promoter interaction with either form of RNA polymerase, and suggests that a G/C bias in the -2/+1 nucleotides would favour efficient promoter recognition by Eσ70.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We have performed in vitro transcription experiments with either Eσ70 or EσS, using the whole E. coli genome as template, to identify promoter regions selectively recognized by two forms of RNA polymerase by using E.coli genome 2.0 GeneChips.
