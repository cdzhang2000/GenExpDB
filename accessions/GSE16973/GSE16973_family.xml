1.  70-mer oligos (Operon - v.1.0.2) representing each ORF of E. coli were arrayed in 384 well plates, total of 600 pmol in each well.
2.  Oligos were suspended in water to 40 uM, and 5 uL were transferred to a new 384 well plate.
3.  The print plates were dried down in a speedvac and resuspended in 5 uL 3x SSC buffer, the day before printing.
4.  Plates were sealed until just before use to prevent evaporation.
5.  Super Amine 2 substrates (Telechem) were arrayed on a robotic spotter (Gene Machines).
6.  The print run was designed to print each gene on a slide 3 times.
7.  After printing, the print plates were dried in a speed-vac and stored at -80 C for storage.  For future printing, the plates were re-suspended in water.
8.  Printed slides were rehydrated over water and UV cross-linked with 150 mJ/cm2.

Feature fluorescence intensities [F532 media-B532 and F635media-B635] were extracted using GenePix Pro 6.0.  Local hybridization and intensity-dependent artifacts were removed with Lowess normalization using Standardization and Normalization of Microarray Data (SNOMAD, http://pevsnerlab.kennedykrieger.org/snomadinput.html).  The three replicate spots for each gene were averaged and variance was calculated.

Feature fluorescence intensities [F532 media-B532 and F635media-B635] were extracted using GenePix Pro 6.0.  Local hybridization and intensity-dependent artifacts were removed with Lowess normalization using Standardization and Normalization of Microarray Data (SNOMAD, http://pevsnerlab.kennedykrieger.org/snomadinput.html).  The three replicate spots for each gene were averaged and variance was calculated.

    <Title>Functional Genomic Study of Exogenous n-Butanol Stress in Escherichia coli</Title>
    <Accession database="GEO">GSE16973</Accession>
    <Pubmed-ID>20118358</Pubmed-ID>
    <Summary>
n-Butanol has been proposed as an alternative biofuel to ethanol, and both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been engineered to produce it.  Unfortunately, n-butanol is more toxic than ethanol to these organisms.  To understand the basis for its toxicity, cell wide studies were conducted at the transcript, protein and metabolite levels to obtain a global view of the n-butanol stress response. Analysis of the data indicate that n-butanol stress has components common to other stress responses and includes perturbation in respiratory functions (nuo, cyo operons), oxidative stress (sodC, katG, yqhD), heat shock and cell envelope stress (rpoE, clpB, htpG, degP, cpxPR), metabolite transport (malE, opp operon) and biosynthesis. Inducible expression of the yqhD gene was found to improve the host’s tolerance to exogenous n-butanol and confirms the role of this gene in coping with butanol stress. To survey for other potential candidates that may serve to improve host tolerance, mutant strains in several candidates which show changes at the transcript and protein levels were examined for sensitivity during butanol exposure. Chassis engineering based on these cues may be required in a high production titer, butanol-producing host.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
This comparison is between E. coli DH1 cells treated with 0.8% n-butanol and untreated cells at 0, 30, 80, and 195 minutes after addition.  3 biological replicates were grown, total RNA was extracted, labeled, and hybridized on 3 slides for each time point.
