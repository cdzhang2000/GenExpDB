1.Qiagen array ready oligo set version 1.0 are arrayed in 384-well V-bottom plates. Each well contains 600 pmol of 70-mer oligo.
2. Resuspend oligos in 3X SSC to 40 uM
3. Freeze plates at -20°C when not in use.
4. Before printing,thaw at 4°C. This can be done the night before a print run is started.
5. Seal plates with Corning seals.
6. Spin for 1 minute at 1000 RPM to settle condensation.
7. One plate at a time, load into microarray robot.
8. Load gal file based on Qiagen provided dataset.
9. Cover with Corning seals and refreeze oligos after print run is complete.

Cultures adapted to 0.2% oxygen (balance nitrogen) for seven days, were transferred to roller bottles with normal atmospheric oxygen and incubated rolling at 37˚C. Samples were collected by pipet and centrifuged at 3500rcf for 10 minute,s then supernatant was removed and pellet was flash frozen on dry ice.

Grown to mid log phase (OD600 0.1-0.3) in roller bottles with a 5:1 headspace ratio in Middlebrook 7H9 media + ADC. Diluted to an OD of 0.1 and cultured for seven days with constant agitation and continuous exposure to 0.2% oxygen (balance nitrogen). Transferred to roller bottles with 5:1 headspace ratio.

Cultures adapted to 0.2% oxygen (balance nitrogen) for seven days, were transferred to roller bottles with normal atmospheric oxygen and incubated rolling at 37˚C. Samples were collected by pipet and centrifuged at 3500rcf for 10 minute,s then supernatant was removed and pellet was flash frozen on dry ice.

Grown to mid log phase (OD600 0.1-0.3) in roller bottles with a 5:1 headspace ratio in Middlebrook 7H9 media + ADC. Diluted to an OD of 0.1 and cultured for seven days with constant agitation and continuous exposure to 0.2% oxygen (balance nitrogen). Transferred to roller bottles with 5:1 headspace ratio.

Standard amino-allyl labelling protocol from TIGR. cDNA made with Superscript III using aminoallyl dUTP. cDNA purified using Qiaquick column from Qiagen. Tags conjugated to reactive Cy dyes in the presence of sodium carbonate. Excess Cy dye removed with a Qiaquick column from Qiagen. Probes resuspended in hyb buffer (50% formamide, 5X SSC, and  0.1% SDS) and kept at room temp until added to array slides.

Slides prehybed for &gt;1 hour in prehyb buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA), washed 2X for 1 minute in water, 15 seconds in isopropanol, dried by centrifugation. Probes added to slides, sealed in incubation chambers and submerged in 42 degree incubator overnight. Arrays washed in increasingly stringent washes: 5 minutes at 42 degrees low stringency wash (0.2%SDS, 1XSSC), 10 minutes lower stringency wash (0.2%SDS, 0.1XSSC), 4 times 1 minute in 0.1XSSC, 10 seconds in 0.01XSSC.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
Cultures adapted to 0.2% oxygen (balance nitrogen) for seven days, were transferred to roller bottles with normal atmospheric oxygen and incubated rolling at 37˚C. Samples were collected by pipet at various timepoints and centrifuged at 3500rcf for 10 minutes, then supernatant was removed and pellet was flash frozen on dry ice.

Grown to mid log phase (OD600 0.1-0.3) in roller bottles with a 5:1 headspace ratio in Middlebrook 7H9 media + ADC. Diluted to an OD of 0.1 and cultured for seven days with constant agitation and continuous exposure to 0.2% oxygen (balance nitrogen). Transferred to roller bottles with 5:1 headspace ratio.

Standard amino-allyl labelling protocol from TIGR. cDNA made with Superscript III using aminoallyl dUTP. cDNA purified using Qiaquick column from Qiagen. Tags conjugated to reactive Cy dyes in the presence of sodium carbonate. Excess Cy dye removed with a Qiaquick column from Qiagen. Probes resuspended in hyb buffer (50% formamide, 5X SSC, and  0.1% SDS) and kept at room temp until added to array slides.

Slides prehybed for &gt;1 hour in prehyb buffer (5X SSC, 0.1% SDS, 1% BSA), washed 2X for 1 minute in water, 15 seconds in isopropanol, dried by centrifugation. Probes added to slides, sealed in incubation chambers and submerged in 42 degree incubator overnight. Arrays washed in increasingly stringent washes: 5 minutes at 42 degrees low stringency wash (0.2%SDS, 1XSSC), 10 minutes lower stringency wash (0.2%SDS, 0.1XSSC), 4 times 1 minute in 0.1XSSC, 10 seconds in 0.01XSSC.

    <Summary>
Reaeration timecourse from a defined hypoxia model in Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

The mechanism by which mycobacteria return to a replicating state upon re-exposure to favorable conditions is not well understood. In this study, we utilized reaeration from a defined hypoxia model to characterize the adaptive response of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) following a return to favorable growth conditions. Global transcriptional analysis identified the ~100 gene Reaeration Response, induced relative to both log-phase and hypoxic MTB. This response includes chaperones and proteases, as well as the transcription factor Rv2745c, a Clp protease gene regulator (ClgR) orthologue.  During reaeration, genes repressed during hypoxia are also upregulated in a wave of transcription that includes genes crucial to transcription, translation and oxidative phosphorylation.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
Each reaerating culture compared at multiple timepoints to a sample from the same culture at seven days of hypoxia. Three or more replicates at each timepoint.
