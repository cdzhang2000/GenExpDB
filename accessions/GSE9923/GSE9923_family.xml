Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

Has 7312 entries and was indexed 20-May-2002.
The GeneChip E. coli Antisense Genome Array can be used for examining expression of all known E. coli genes and discovering novel, uncharacterized intergenic transcripts. The array contains probe sets to detect the antisense strand of more than 4,200 known open reading frames. In addition, over 1,350 intergenic sequences can be interrogated in both directions permitting functional characterization of potentially important shorter expressed sequences.
Sequence information for probes on the array correspond to the M49 version of the E. coli Genome Project database at the University of Wisconsin.

    <Description>
Affymetrix submissions are typically submitted to GEO using the GEOarchive method described at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/geo/info/geo_affy.html

The GeneChipÂ® E. coli Genome 2.0 Array contains probe sets to detect transcripts from the K12 strain of E. coli and three pathogenic strains of E. coli. Using the new E. coli Genome 2.0 Array, researchers can gain a comprehensive view of three pathogenic forms of E. coli while continuing ongoing research projects with the K12 strain.

The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array includes approximately 10,000 probe sets for all 20,366 genes present in four strains of E. coli. Due to the high degree of similarity between the E. coli strains, whenever possible, a single probe set is tiled to represent the equivalent ortholog in all four strains. The GeneChip E. coli Genome 2.0 Array tiles probe sets over the entire open reading frame (ORF) of E. coli, includes over 700 intergenic regions, probes for various antibiotic resistance markers, and incorporates additional control and reporter genes from the previous generation E. coli array.

The overnight culture (2.5 ml) was used to inoculate 250 ml of fresh LB medium with 10 g of submerged glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and with 100 uM indole for forming biofilm. After incubation for 7 h at 30Â°C with shaking (250 rpm), the glass wool was carefully and quickly removed and rinsed with 100 ml of sterile 0.85% NaCl solution at 0Â°C. Biofilm cells were removed by sonicating the glass wool in 200 ml of sterile 0.85% NaCl solution at 0Â°C.

      <Extract-Protocol>
The overnight culture (2.5 ml) was used to inoculate 250 ml of fresh LB medium with 10 g of submerged glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, NY) and DMF for forming biofilm. After incubation for 7 h at 30Â°C with shaking (250 rpm), the glass wool was carefully and quickly removed and rinsed with 100 ml of sterile 0.85% NaCl solution at 0Â°C. Biofilm cells were removed by sonicating the glass wool in 200 ml of sterile 0.85% NaCl solution at 0Â°C. After breaking the cells with a bead beater, and the total RNA was isolated with Qiagen RNeasy mini Kit (Cat# 74104).

    <Title>Indole cell signaling occurs primarily at low temperatures in Escherichia coli</Title>

    <Summary>
We have shown the quorum-sensing signals acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs), autoinducer-2 (AI-2), and indole influence the biofilm formation of Escherichia coli.  Here, we investigate how the environment, i.e., temperature, affects indole and AI-2 signaling in E. coli. We show in biofilms that indole addition leads to more extensive differential gene expression at 30Â°C (186 genes) than at 37Â°C (59 genes), that indole reduces biofilm formation (without affecting growth) more significantly at 25Â°C and 30Â°C than at 37Â°C, and that the effect is associated with the quorum-sensing protein SdiA. The addition of indole at 30Â°C compared to 37Â°C most significantly repressed genes involved in uridine monophosphate (UMP) biosynthesis (carAB, pyrLBI, pyrC, pyrD pyrF, and upp) and uracil transport (uraA). These uracil-related genes are also repressed at 30Â°C by SdiA, which confirms SdiA is involved in indole signaling. Also, compared to 37Â°C, indole more significantly decreased flagella-related qseB, flhD, and fliA promoter activity, enhanced antibiotic resistance, and inhibited cell division at 30Â°C.  In contrast to indole and SdiA, the addition of (S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (the AI-2 precursor) leads to more extensive differential gene expression at 37Â°C (63 genes) than at 30Â°C (11 genes), and, rather than repressing UMP synthesis genes, AI-2 induces them at 37Â°C (but not at 30Â°C). Also, the addition of AI-2 induces the transcription of virulence genes in enterohemorrhagic E. coli O157:H7 at 37Â°C but not at 30Â°C. Hence, cell signals cause diverse responses at different temperatures, and indole- and AI-2-based signaling are intertwined.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
We performed seven sets of microarray experiments in LB medium (Table 2): (i) biofilm cells of the BW25113 wild-type strain grown for 7 h at 30Â°C vs. 37Â°C to determine the effect of temperature on E. coli biofilm formation (initial absorbance of 0.05), (ii) biofilm cells of the tnaA mutant grown for 7 h with 1 mM indole vs. no indole at 30Â°C to determine the effect of temperature on indole signaling in E. coli (initial absorbance of 0.05), (iii) biofilm cells of the tnaA mutant grown for 7 h with 1 mM indole vs. no indole at 37Â°C to determine the effect of temperature on indole signaling in E. coli, (iv) suspension cells of the wild-type strain vs. the sdiA mutant at an absorbance of 4.0 at 600 nm  at 30Â°C (since production of indole takes place primarily in the stationary phase) to discern the genes that SdiA controls (initial absorbance of 0.05), (v) biofilm cells of the sdiA mutant grown for 7 h with 1 mM indole vs. no indole at 30Â°C to determine gene expression in response to indole in the absence of SdiA, (vi) suspension cells of the luxS mutant with 100 micro M AI-2 vs. no AI-2 at 30Â°C for 3 h to determine the effect of temperature on AI-2 signaling in E. coli (initial absorbance of 0.5), and (vii) suspension cells of the luxS mutant with 100 micro M AI-2 vs. no AI-2 at 37Â°C for 3 h to determine the effect of temperature on AI-2 signaling in E. coli.  Ten g of glass wool (Corning Glass Works, Corning, N.Y.) was used to form large amounts of biofilms (Ren et al., 2004a) in 250 mL LB in 1 L Erlenmeyer shake flasks. RNA was isolated from the suspension and biofilm cells as described previously (Ren et al., 2004b).
