2723 genes and 144 intergenic regions of strain 13 were amplified by PCR with gene-specific primers and PCR products were confirmed by gel electrophoresis
In total, 2867 probes were spotted onto poly-L-Lysine coated glass slides in twice (SD10011; Matsunami Glass Ind., Osaka, Japan) using SPBIO (Hitachi Software Engineering, Tokyo, Japan).

15 µg of total RNA from was mixed with 2 µl of random primers (d(N)6, d(N)9, 0.5 µg/µl each, Takara, Japan) and adjusted to 22 µl with water. The solution was kept at 65°C for 5 min to denature the RNA. The annealing reaction was performed at 42°C for 5 min. The premix solution (18 µl) was mixed into RNA solution, and reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 60 min. The premix solution was a mixture of 8 µl of x5 power script reaction buffer, 4 µl of dNTPs (5 mM dATP, 5 mM dCTP, 5 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP, 3 mM amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma, USA)), 4 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 0.1 µl of RNase inhibitor (TakaRa, Japan), and 2 µl of Powerscript reverse transcriptase (BD Biosciences, USA). After incubation, 5 µl of 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 10 µl of 1 N NaOH were mixed, and the mixture was incubated at 65°C for 30 min to stop the reaction and remove the RNA templates, followed by the addition of 25 µl of 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) for neutralization. The mixture was transferred to a Microcon-30 filter (Millipore, USA) and centrifuged. The filter was washed with 100 µl of water 4 times, and the sample was eluted in 25 µl of water.  The solution was completely dried, re-suspended in 10 µl of 50 mM NaCO3, and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 3 min.  Ten microliters of Cy3 or Cy5 (GE Healthcare, USA) was mixed and incubated at RT for 60 min in a dark place. Ten microliters of Na2OH (Sigma) was added to remove un-reacted Cy-dye. Finally, the labeled product was purified by a QIAquick column (Qiagen, Germany).

The solution was kept at 65°C for 5 min to denature the RNA. The annealing reaction was performed at 42°C for 5 min. The premix solution (18 µl) was mixed into RNA solution, and reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 60 min. The premix solution was a mixture of 8 µl of x5 power script reaction buffer, 4 µl of dNTPs (5 mM dATP, 5 mM dCTP, 5 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP, 3 mM amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma, USA)), 4 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 0.1 µl of RNase inhibitor (TakaRa, Japan), and 2 µl of Powerscript reverse transcriptase (BD Biosciences, USA). After incubation, 5 µl of 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 10 µl of 1 N NaOH were mixed, and the mixture was incubated at 65°C for 30 min to stop the reaction and remove the RNA templates, followed by the addition of 25 µl of 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) for neutralization. The mixture was transferred to a Microcon-30 filter (Millipore, USA) and centrifuged. The filter was washed with 100 µl of water 4 times, and the sample was eluted in 25 µl of water.  The solution was completely dried, re-suspended in 10 µl of 50 mM NaCO3, and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 3 min.  Ten microliters of Cy3 or Cy5 (GE Healthcare, USA) was mixed and incubated at RT for 60 min in a dark place. Ten microliters of Na2OH (Sigma) was added to remove un-reacted Cy-dye. Finally, the labeled product was purified by a QIAquick column (Qiagen, Germany).

The solution was kept at 65°C for 5 min to denature the RNA. The annealing reaction was performed at 42°C for 5 min. The premix solution (18 µl) was mixed into RNA solution, and reverse transcription was performed at 42 °C for 60 min. The premix solution was a mixture of 8 µl of x5 power script reaction buffer, 4 µl of dNTPs (5 mM dATP, 5 mM dCTP, 5 mM dGTP, 2 mM dTTP, 3 mM amino-allyl dUTP (Sigma, USA)), 4 µl of 0.1 M DTT, 0.1 µl of RNase inhibitor (TakaRa, Japan), and 2 µl of Powerscript reverse transcriptase (BD Biosciences, USA). After incubation, 5 µl of 0.5M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 10 µl of 1 N NaOH were mixed, and the mixture was incubated at 65°C for 30 min to stop the reaction and remove the RNA templates, followed by the addition of 25 µl of 1 M Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) for neutralization. The mixture was transferred to a Microcon-30 filter (Millipore, USA) and centrifuged. The filter was washed with 100 µl of water 4 times, and the sample was eluted in 25 µl of water.  The solution was completely dried, re-suspended in 10 µl of 50 mM NaCO3, and incubated at room temperature (RT) for 3 min.  Ten microliters of Cy3 or Cy5 (GE Healthcare, USA) was mixed and incubated at RT for 60 min in a dark place. Ten microliters of Na2OH (Sigma) was added to remove un-reacted Cy-dye. Finally, the labeled product was purified by a QIAquick column (Qiagen, Germany).

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Hybridization solution (25 μl of Cy-dye-labeled cDNA solution, 10 μl of x20 SSC, 3 μl of water, and 2 μl of 10% SDS) was poured onto the slide glass and covered with a cover-glass with a gap (Matsunami Glass). The slide was inserted into the hybridization chamber, and hybridization was performed at 60 °C overnight.

    <Scan-Protocol>
Scanned on an FLA-8000 scanner (Fuji Film, Japan). The density of the scanned spots was measured by ArrayVision software (Imaging Research, USA)

    <Summary>
The microarrays were subjected to two-color hybridization using Cy5 and Cy3 dyes incorporated in the cDNAs synthesized from total RNA samples of strains.  We compared each gene’s transcription level between the wild-type (WT) strain 13 (labeled by Cy5) and the VirR-mutant strain (TS133) or VR-RNA-mutant strain (TS140) (both labeled by Cy3) on a single DNA microarray.

Keywords: gene regulation in time course

    <Overall-Design>
Each sample represent data calculated from 3 to 4 biological  replicates of independent experiments. Each biological replicate contains duplicated data.
