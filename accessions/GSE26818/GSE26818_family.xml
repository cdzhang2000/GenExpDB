2,857 70mer oligonucleotides were designed by and purchased from Operon Biotechnologies, Inc. (Huntsville, AL, USA) to represent 2,857 ORFs from Listeria monocytogenes EGD. 70mer oligonucleotides were designed for 61 Listeria innocua ORFs (based on L. innocua Clip 11262) and five Saccharomyces cerevisiae ORFs (to serve as negative controls) using ArrayOligoSelector (http://arrayoligosel.sourceforge.net). Oligonucleotides were resuspended in 1X SSC + 0.0025% Sarkosyl to a final concentration of 25uM. All oligonucleotides and controls were spotted in duplicate on Corning UltraGAPS slides (Corning, NY, USA) using a custom built XYZ microarrayer (based on the original design of Pat Brown from Stanford University). Oligonucleotides were UV-crosslinked at 300mJ for 1 minute. Printing quality was checked using Cy3-labeled random sequence nonamers.

RNA was purified using the RNeasy mini or midi kit from Qiagen as described by the manufacturer. Cells grown to early-stationary phase were first treated with RNA protect as instructed by the manufacturer (Qiagen) and subsequently disrupted by sonication on ice (3 X 30 seconds, each round followed by a 30 second pause). RNA was then extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy kit. The integrity of the RNA was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the concentration and purity was determined on a NanoDrop 2000.

      <Label>Cy3 or Cy5</Label>
      <Label-Protocol>
cDNA from each strain was labeled twice with Cy3 and twice with Cy5 to minimize any bias. cDNA synthesis and labeling of total RNA were performed using the SuperScript Plus indirect cDNA labeling system for DNA microarrays (Invitrogen). 10 µg total RNA was mixed with 5 µg random hexamers and incubated for 10 minutes at 70ºC, with a subsequent chill on ice for at least 5 minutes. Superscript III RT, amino-modified deoxynucleoside triphophates, dithiothreitol, RNaseOUT, and buffer was then added and the reaction mix incubated at 42ºC for 17 hours. RNA was hydrolyzed by the addition of 10 µl 1M NaOH and 10 µl 0.5 M EDTA, followed by incubation at 65ºC for 15 minutes. The mixture was neutralized with 10 µl 1M HCl and cDNA purified using the Qiagen PCR purification kit. Labeling reactions with Alexa Fluor 555 or Alexa Fluor 647 fluorescent dyes were performed for 2 h at room temperature. Differentially labeled cDNAs from the two strains to be cohybridized were combined, dried in a Savant SVC100 Speed-Vac (Farmingdale) and stored at -80ºC until hybridization.

    <Hybridization-Protocol>
Spotted microarray slides were first incubated for 1 h in a 1% bovine serum albumin-5X SSC-0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate solution pre-warmed to 42ºC. Subsequently, slides were washed twice in 0.1X SSC and twice in filtered water and then dried. The combined cDNA targets were reconstituted in 55 µl hybridization buffer and denatured at 95ºC for 5 minutes. Targets were applied to microarray slides and overlaid with mSeries LifterSlips (Erie Scientific) followed by overnight hybridization at 42ºC. Slides were then washed 5 minutes in 42ºC pre-warmed 2X SSC plus 0.1% SDS, 5 minutes in 2X SCC, and 2.5 min in 0.2X SSC. 
    </Hybridization-Protocol>
    <Scan-Protocol>
After a final wash in filtered water, slides were dried and scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
    </Scan-Protocol>
    <Data-Processing>
The median fluorescence intensity data for all probes on the array were analyzed using LIMMA (linear models for microarray analysis). We first normalized the data on each array using print-tip Lowess, followed by log2 conversion of the normalized data. A correlation was determined for the signal from duplicate spots of each probe. Significant differences were determined by calculating a moderated t-statistic which is similar to an ordinary t-statistic except that the standard errors have been shrunk towards a common value using a Bayesian model. P-values were calculated for each gene based on the moderated t-statistics and adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate correction for multiple tests. Differences in transcripts levels were considered meaningful only when adjusted P &lt; 0.05 and fold change &gt; 1.5.

    <Summary>
In recent years, more than 60 small RNAs (sRNAs) have been identified in the gram-positive human pathogen Listeria monocytogenes, but their putative roles and mechanisms of action remain largely unknown. The sRNA LhrA was recently shown to be a post-transcriptional regulator of a single gene, lmo0850, which encodes a small protein of unknown function. LhrA controls the translation and degradation of the lmo0850 mRNA by an antisense mechanism, and it depends on the RNA chaperone Hfq for efficient binding to its target. In the present study, we sought to gain more insight into the functional role of LhrA in L. monocytogenes. To this end, we determined the effects of LhrA on global-wide gene expression. We observed that nearly 300 genes in L. monocytogenes are either positively or negatively affected by LhrA. Among these genes, we identified lmo0302 and chiA as direct targets of LhrA, thus establishing LhrA as a multiple target regulator. Lmo0302 encodes a hypothetical protein with no known function, whereas chiA encodes one of two chitinases present in L. monocytogenes. We show here that LhrA acts as a post-transcriptional regulator of lmo0302 and chiA by interfering with ribosome recruitment, and we provide evidence that both LhrA and Hfq act to down-regulate the expression of lmo0302 and chiA. Furthermore, in vitro binding experiments show that Hfq stimulates the base pairing of LhrA to chiA mRNA. Finally, we demonstrate that LhrA has a negative effect on the chitinolytic activity of L. monocytogenes. In marked contrast to this, we found that Hfq has a stimulating effect on the chitinolytic activity, suggesting that Hfq plays multiple roles in the complex regulatory pathways controlling the chitinases of L. monocytogenes.
