For cellobiose, the following dilution rates were studied (h-1, calculated from the mass flow rate of the collected effluent): 0.025; 0.048; 0.064; 0.0129 and 0.158. For cellulose, the following dilution rates were studied (h-1): 0.013; 0.032; 0.061; 0.084; 0.105; 0.129; 0.159 and 0.206. The dilution rate (D) is synonymous with the growth rate of the organism at steady-state operation.
      </Treatment-Protocol>
      <Growth-Protocol>
C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was grown on Sigmacell 50 microcrystalline cellulose (equivalent to Avicel PH101) and used as an inoculum for chemostat studies. Cells were grown at 55°C in chemostat culture with continuous stirring. Modified Dehority medium containing (per liter) 3.0 g of cellobiose or 2.7 to 3.1 g of Sigmacell 20 microcrystalline cellulose (Sigma) was delivered to the reactor as segmented slurry. Chemostats were operated to steady state (minimum turnover of three reactor volumes) prior to sampling.
      </Growth-Protocol>
      <Molecule>total RNA</Molecule>
      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was isolated from freshly collected cells. cDNA was synthesized from isolated RNA and stored at -80˚C prior to use. Total DNA was isolated using the Promega Wizard genomic DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and treated with DNase-free RNase ONE (Promega) following DNA extraction.

    <Data-Processing>
The data was extracted from scanned images using NimbleScan software.  Expression values were generated using quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average algorithm. The calls file contained 8 replicate intensities for each probe set. These were log2 transformed and further summarized by taking the means of the log-transformed values.

For cellobiose, the following dilution rates were studied (h-1, calculated from the mass flow rate of the collected effluent): 0.025; 0.048; 0.064; 0.0129 and 0.158. For cellulose, the following dilution rates were studied (h-1): 0.013; 0.032; 0.061; 0.084; 0.105; 0.129; 0.159 and 0.206. The dilution rate (D) is synonymous with the growth rate of the organism at steady-state operation.

C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was grown on Sigmacell 50 microcrystalline cellulose (equivalent to Avicel PH101) and used as an inoculum for chemostat studies. Cells were grown at 55°C in chemostat culture with continuous stirring. Modified Dehority medium containing (per liter) 3.0 g of cellobiose or 2.7 to 3.1 g of Sigmacell 20 microcrystalline cellulose (Sigma) was delivered to the reactor as segmented slurry. Chemostats were operated to steady state (minimum turnover of three reactor volumes) prior to sampling.

The data was extracted from scanned images using NimbleScan software.  Expression values were generated using quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average algorithm. The calls file contained 8 replicate intensities for each probe set. These were log2 transformed and further summarized by taking the means of the log-transformed values.

      <Treatment-Protocol>
For cellobiose, the following dilution rates were studied (h-1, calculated from the mass flow rate of the collected effluent): 0.025; 0.048; 0.064; 0.0129 and 0.158. For cellulose, the following dilution rates were studied (h-1): 0.013; 0.032; 0.061; 0.084; 0.105; 0.129; 0.159 and 0.206. The dilution rate (D) is synonymous with the growth rate of the organism at steady-state operation.

      <Growth-Protocol>
C. thermocellum ATCC 27405 was grown on Sigmacell 50 microcrystalline cellulose (equivalent to Avicel PH101) and used as an inoculum for chemostat studies. Cells were grown at 55°C in chemostat culture with continuous stirring. Modified Dehority medium containing (per liter) 3.0 g of cellobiose or 2.7 to 3.1 g of Sigmacell 20 microcrystalline cellulose (Sigma) was delivered to the reactor as segmented slurry. Chemostats were operated to steady state (minimum turnover of three reactor volumes) prior to sampling.

      <Extract-Protocol>
Total RNA was isolated from freshly collected cells. cDNA was synthesized from isolated RNA and stored at -80˚C prior to use. Total DNA was isolated using the Promega Wizard genomic DNA kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and treated with DNase-free RNase ONE (Promega) following DNA extraction.

    </Description>
    <Data-Processing>
The data was extracted from scanned images using NimbleScan software.  Expression values were generated using quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average algorithm. The calls file contained 8 replicate intensities for each probe set. These were log2 transformed and further summarized by taking the means of the log-transformed values.

    <Summary>
Earlier studies pointed to the ability of C. thermocellum to exquisitely control gene expression in response to growth rate and the presence of insoluble cellulose or soluble compounds such as cellobiose.  This microarray study was carried out in order to examine expression responses of the entire genome. The use of the chemostat technique allowed the effects of different growth rates to be analyzed separately from the effects of different substrates.
    </Summary>
    <Overall-Design>
